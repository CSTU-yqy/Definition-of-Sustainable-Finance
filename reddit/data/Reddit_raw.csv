Think Like a Climate Investor #1 [Series],"Good investors (us) should always be modeling possible futures.
Section 45V of the IRA offers $100+ billion incentives for clean hydrogen...
... but the IRS gets to define clean hydrogen and how it’s made (and who qualifies for these tax credits).
So how do we know if clean hydrogen-producing companies are legit & deserve the credit?
Climate orgs think that lack of additionality & hourly matching can cause hydrogen companies to produce far more carbon than they’re saving & could even make this process less competitive with traditional methods - defeating the purpose.

Congrats to those that passed the CESGA March Exam!,CESGA just announced the results for the CESGA exam in March. Congrats to those that just passed it!,"I have no idea how I passed it, but it was a great relief.
Me too haha
I’ve never heard of this designation. Looks interesting! It seems like a similar curriculum to the CFA ESG Investing Course; how does it differ?
TBH, the curriculum isn't the greatest, there's a lot of jargon and financial background that they kind of just skimmed over. I can definitely see someone struggling if they're coming in without prior knowledge. However, I do think that the ability to add CESGA designation to the business card (akin to CFA) is useful in certain situations.
I personally can't comment on the difference with the CFA ESG course, but I do see a lot of job listings treating both CFA ESG and CESGA equally.

Roundup of new ways to invest in climate this month,"It's not easy finding climate-specific investments so I did the legwork for you.
Split between public market vs private market news
https://investwithintention.substack.com/p/new-ways-to-invest-in-climate-april
What did I miss?","
I’ve gotten into a few innovative climate tech companies (floating wind, thin film solar, tidal stream, etc etc) and love watching them go through their journey.
Feels like you’re really contributing to the solution when you give startups capital and have the added bonus of the chance for big gains (and losses)
Just checked it out - love this!
RaiseGreen is doing something similar with the crowdfunding model in climate. The only hesitation I have with crowdfunding is doing all of the due diligence before I make an investment. Do you have any advice on how to go about that?
It is typically possible to ask any question you like to the company representatives (often the founder themself) when they are fundraising, and if you are investing significant money (10k+) you may be able to set up a direct conversation with them if you are that way inclined.
The best research I say is to look at who the team is and investigate their track record. Successful previous startups? Long LinkedIn history with influential jobs? Good connections? The companies are inherently extremely ambitious so you can never quite trust their growth trajectory, but see it as a best case scenario
You are definitely gambling with crowdfunding campaigns whatever way you spin it, but see it as a high risk corner of your portfolio… one of my investments just closed a second funding round at 1704% higher valuation while two of my investments look like they are going bankrupt, so you win big and you lose big.",8 days ago,"['Fri, Apr 28, 2023, 09:46:57 PM Central European Summer Time']",
"What the US Can Learn From Europe’s ESG Mistakes. The EU isn’t worried about wokeness, but it’s struggling to develop rules that would help investors avoid greenwashing.",,"Serious reform of the financial system is nigh impossible. After a crisis, people fiddle at the margin, tweak some variables, declare victory, the narrative moves on to other pursuits. Until there is another crisis.
Think about it: we now have a mini-banking crisis because... drum roll... interest rates went up. Do you think this level of incompetence can ever deliver the serious change that is needed for sustainable finance.
But the sustainability constraint is not just another crisis to shove under the carpet. Its not going to go away unless there is a real transition. Greenwashing can kick the can a lot. But it cannot change reality. So ESG and all the frameworks people currently work on will see countless revisions as the pressure cooker keeps heating up.
Financial system broken ? You’re only pointing at the symptom, not the core problem.
Core problem is there is a corrupt political system captured and controlled by those with money: https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf
If you see a broken financial system, it’s stemming from the same corruption that is resuming in a health system that is broken, the same broken govt that results in Americans breathing dirty air and drinking poisoned water.
As such you can’t magically expect a financial system to be fixed or “ESG” to be a magical pixie dust that solves everything.
First government has to work for the people, if you want a properly functioning economic system.
There is a lot of truth (and merit) seeking ultimate (root) causes and sustainability is a significant enough challenge that wont be addressed with superficial measures.
Ofcourse seeking to adress deeper causes raises the bar for meaningful change. Remedies stop being technocratic fixes and require deeper societal change. Which may or may not be forthcoming.
The recurrent bailouts (socialization of private losses) are just one the most visible manifestations of how the financial system is particularly dependent on its cozy relation with the state. It is directly affected by the quality of the political system and in many countries it is a thinly disguised extension of the government.
Yet while it is difficult to objectively rank the backwardness of different sectors, banking would stand out as a laggard compared to most. A banker from Renaissance Italy would probably be functional today with minimal retraining in excel and powerpoint.
So the challenge of sustainable finance is more like a compounded specific sectoral problem within a broader societal problem.
But honestly this dismal state means it is also more conceivable to achieve tangible progress. The darkest hour is before dawn.
What is “ESG”, a bandage because governments wont do their job and regulate.
Nobody should be “greenwashing” with this stuff. Its stuff they should all have to do, by law end of story.
I mean nobody ever goes to customers to say how proud they are of not bribing or taking bribes from others. Because hey that‘s just the damn law.
the EU experience has been complicated partly because activity based thinking keeps getting in the way of effect based thinking.
The esrs/ csrd, despite intentions, is still mixing and blurring the two. The taxonomy is even worse, basing the entire framework first in defined sets of activities rather than effects/ outcomes.
The problem with ESG is that it is asking capitalism to evolve to a higher level of optimization — maximizing the common good — than is hard-wired into its DNA. The result is bound to be frustrating. But the alternative of capitalism playing out its id-game, without regard to the consequences of its profit drive, is deadly to liberty, justice, democracy, and the planet. ESG needs to be guided by civil society operating through active public citizens, and government policy to plot out a common roadmap so that individual corporate actions are better aligned to work as the efficient supply chains to build the economy we need to live equitably within planetary limits. We can't get to where we need to be by central planning, but we do need enough commonality of vision so that it pays for us to work cooperatively.",8 days ago,[],Greenwashing

Created some visualizations that show the consolidations undertaken by the IFRS Foundation and the connections between the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards and other corporate reporting requirements. Explore the Board containing these visualizations using the link.,,"Context for the visualizations:
At COP 26, the IFRS Foundation (a global standard-setting organization) committed to consolidating leading investor-focused sustainability disclosure organizations into ISSB - a board created by the Foundation to develop a comprehensive global baseline of sustainability disclosure standards that meet the information needs of investors.
The sustainability reporting space was fragmented due to the availability of several voluntary reporting frameworks and guidance. The overarching goal of these consolidations is to streamline and formalize corporate sustainability disclosures.
Since their commitment at COP26, sustainability disclosure organizations including the IIRC, SASB Foundation and CDSB along with their reporting requirements (Integrated Reporting Framework, SASB Standards and CDSB Framework) got consolidated into the IFRS Foundation.
On March 2022, the ISSB published drafts of the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards. These standards build on and incorporate the work of TCFD Recommendations, SASB Standards, Integrated Reporting Framework, etc.
The IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards will replace existing sustainability reporting requirements once they are finalized and published. It has been tentatively decided that they will become effective from January 2024.
I have attempted to map out these developments using some visualizations.
One of them shows how the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards connect with existing standards and frameworks in the corporate reporting space.
The second one illustrates the consolidations undertaken by the IFRS Foundation.
I wasn't able to export a high-resolution image of these visualizations. So, feel free to access the Board containing these visualizations to explore them better.

ESG Data Competitive Environment Question - Personal Research Project Crowdsourcing,"Hello all!
I'm a student at the George Washington University's School of Business and am doing some research for a project on the ESG data providers competitive environment. I have looked for some information online and haven't found all that much so I was hoping that you could help me!
I've grouped together MSCI, ISS ESG, Sustainalytics, ESG Book, Bloomberg, and Moody's. I have a range of information on them already (companies covered, # of sources, data types, data collection process, frequency of reporting, financial materiality tested, etc.), and am looking to understand if there is any reason that I do not have appearing in my data that a customer/user would choose one company over another.
If you had to choose between the companies or services that I have listed above, which one would you choose? Why?
If there is already a trend of where customers are going, which company/companies are they going to? Should I include anybody else in my list?
Thank you so much in advance, everybody! I look forward to reading your responses!","I would choose the company that covers my portfolio the best, I would also choose the company that is constantly improving its data quality and that is updating its database based on its clients' needs.
To those you have mentionned you might wanna add S&P Trucost and Refinitiv.
Please note that all of these companies' databases are based on reported data by the companies themselves, which could be biased sometimes (companies not reporting all scope 3 categories for example), or based on their estimations, which is worse than companies' reported data. I have an experience calculating a portfolio's CO2 emissions, the best data providers for the energy sector emissions are much different than those you mentioned. You can search for : Rystad, IHS Markit, Wood Mckenzie and others...
Keep us posted for your deliverable, would be very interested.
Hi Silent!
Thanks for your response! Much appreciated.
Given that a lot of data purchases are going to be need-based, what would you say gives the most coverage (for yourself, and generally speaking)?
I'll look into the ones you mentioned as well. Thanks for that!
I'm not sure I'll be able to post the deliverable on here as it may end up being used by my university but I'll definitely keep you posted on that front!
I'd like to add that from a Corporate's perspective, out of all the ESG rating agencies, S&P CSA requests the most comprehensive and detailed information. I can see S&P CSA being the gold standard of ESG scores in the foreseeable future simply because of the amount of data they've been collecting.
Sustainability has a lot of great coverage for small and mid-cap companies, but their data can be very error-prone and does not fully reflect the situation on the ground.

Campaigners sue EU for labelling gas sustainable,,"If you oppose gas... and nuclear I have to assume you also oppose families staying warm during the winter.
This is a false argument (actually fear mongering) that does not help the discussion. The point of the article is about what is considered (labelled) sustainable. It is not even about the labels as such, it is about what financial treatment, tax breaks, subsidies etc the different forms of energy production receive. If you do not change any incentives and label everything ""green"" nothing will ever change.
I don't know exactly where you get the point of the article. clearly I read it. I was responding to the body of the article and not the headline. I don't think I am fear mongering as many in first world nations could not afford to heat their homes this last winter... I support the transition to more carbon nuetral sources of energy and from what I understand that's what natural gas and nuclear are at present day.
I think most of us in this sub would be in the same boat regarding heating costs. The debate is not about stopping non-renewable sources of energy - in the short to medium term this is obviously impossible.

The Real Climate Job of the Future: Carbon Accountant,,"
I am a Sustainability consultant, and it is a big part of the work my company does already..
I am aware that there is a massive push to make this happen and that a lot of people are working on it.
I have been approached by several firms including MBBs to work on this stuff.
I am well aware of the desire to make it happen.
I am merely saying that I think it will die on the vine.
If you feel inclined to do so, feel free to expand on what you see happening, e.g., in a long form post format. Not everything posted here needs to be a link - people can discuss freely things that matter to this domain :-)
I think it's already in progress... I'm a normal accountant and we're already seeing the IASB (who make international/non-US accounting standards) creating the ISSB to create international sustainability standards. That's an attempt to consolidate all the frameworks created by multiple other boards including the EU (the EU one will be compulsory for some businesses next year).
All of these need someone to figure out a process, do the recording and audit the data relating to carbon/other environmental impacts. At a recent networking day there were a number of former normal accountants already pivoted into this.
Have faith, it will.
At the national aggregate level it has happened already but it is limited to a few specialists at statistical agencies and such.
Pushing this type of accounting down to the micro level is required if people are going to manage the sustainability transition at all. (There is a self-destruct scenario ofcourse, but I dont see it as a central thesis. Deniers, procrastinators etc simply delay the inevitable need to live within planetary boundaries).
The practical question for people's actions and careers is how soon and how wide the scope. Financial accounting took centuries to develop but it did not benefit from the amazing technical tools we developed since. Heck, when Paccioli formalized double entry bookkeeping in Renaissance Italy even the concept of zero (0) was a novelty. Today we have the most incredible digital technologies. Once people are incentivised to properly account for sustainability (using taxes, budgets, prices or whatever mechanism) they will do so in large numbers.
p.s I think ""carbon accountant"" is simply the first concept we will start accounting seriously (next to money). Once the spell of only ever focusing on monetary accounts is broken there is a whole range of important real world value metrics to keep track of.
It's already happening. It's very common in the sustainability industry - loads of companies do it",14 days ago,"['Sat, Apr 22, 2023, 11:33:37 PM Central European Summer Time']",Paywall

We understand that it’s much more efficient to start with the end goal and work backwards to generate the best-fit solution. Instead of manually dealing with loads of data for each project and randomly selecting projects with the aim of reaching the final sustainability goals, our users simply enter the end goal of their portfolios and then get a combination of projects that best achieves these goals (together with a recommendation for budget allocation).
I hope it answered your quistion, please let me know if you have other questions.
Is it like robo-advising for carbon offsetting? It’s interesting to know the mechanics behind it. I wasn’t involved in the carbon offsetting process of our company, though the result was presented to me. I know they offered all sorts of individual projects you can invest into, they gave recommendations on what types of projects, locations, etc, that might be interesting to our company.
Just out of curiosity, how is it managed with different marketplaces? I’ve always wondered how you ensure credits aren’t double sold, how to verify the effectiveness of the offsetting, etc. It seems like there’s no central governing body, is that right?
I liked the term ""robo-advising"" for presenting what we do, will consider to use it :)
Regarding your question - there's no central governing body in the Voluntary Carbon Market. The ""governing"" bodies are called registries / programs (e.g. Verra, Gold Standard etc.) and they are the entity responable for veryfing the effectivness, the Exclusive claim (no double sold) etc.",19 days ago,"['Mon, Apr 17, 2023, 05:07:27 PM Central European Summer Time']",Startup / New Venture

I would look at members of SIF. There's been so much M&A in the space lately, so will be tough to find 100% in ESG. You might consider firms working on impact investments.
What country/state?
Anywhere in USA!
I’m only familiar with ones in Europe. You can filter for investment/asset managers on the B Corp website by location as a starting point. It doesn’t guarantee they are only dedicated to only ESG but there’s criteria to be a B Corp that requires a high degree of ethical and sustainable behaviour - in theory.
Quite a few actually, but many are small ISH in size. You'll need to give us a rough indication of the country you're looking at

"I created Sustainability Wiki - a Public Wiki aimed at gathering ESG & Sustainability related content. Check out the wiki at esgwiki.notion.site It's aimed to be a collaborative project so feel free to provide your contributions, feedbacks and suggestions.",,"u/SustainabilityWiki Do you know of any Notion templates out there (paid or free) that are basically a “corporate ESG/Sustainability management system”? Like, interconnected databases, pages, etc that attempt to mimic some of the basic functionalities of an ESG management platform (a la Equilibrium ESG, Sustaira, etc)?
Notion is certainly not the best place to have such a platform, but for VERY small companies or even medium companies that are just getting started, I bet it would be quite useful!
Hey, That would be very useful indeed, although I'm not aware of any such templates on Notion. Also as you mentioned, Notion is not a good platform for this purpose. It would be difficult to mimic the functionalities of ESG management platforms like creating dashboards, calculating carbon emissions and so on.
I can't think of any useful platform either that could serve the same purpose. You can maybe break down the services provided by these platforms and deal with them one by one. For instance, use an open source RDBMS for data management, Tableau or Power BI for creating dashboards and Python scripts for automating the calculation of GHG emissions and so on.
Do tell me if you find any better solution for the same !!
Honestly, a combo of Notion and https://fibery.io would solve this small-scale use case big time, I just don’t have the time to work out the entire schemas necessary. But if someone did that, they could probably make a side-hustle amount of extra chedda from startups wanting to track ESG shtuff.
That's a brilliant idea. Didn't know about fibery.io until now but it seems perfect for your requirements. Maybe fibery.io by itself could get the job done, based on what I just learned about the platform. It does almost all the stuff that Notion does plus it's better for working with databases and for automating stuff. Better for work management.
Also, just want to let you know that I don't have a background in tech or project management. My experience with Notion started with taking notes on it as a student and I learned more about its features over time.
It would be great if someone works on this idea of yours. Would be very useful for startups and making some bucks off it is a really good incentive!
Is it possible to get 15Rock added? We model 86k public companied and public funds + 5 M private firms.
Free access to public for non commercial(personal usuage).
Currently, the Tools page of the Wiki contains a list of such tools.
I have set some basic criteria for the list:
The Sustainability sector is booming and many companies are entering the fold by releasing innovative tools and services. Freemium business models are used by most of them to attract clients. Based on a quick overview of 15Rock 's website, the service that your firm is offering seems to be a freemium service as well. The service is not completely free to the public.
If I include 15Rock in the list, then I would have to add the countless other companies in the sector that are following a similar model. That would render the list useless.
If I don't include all the other companies, then it would create a biased list.

I'm deciding not to add it to the list since 15Rock doesn't meet the criteria. Hoping that my decision is justified.
Feel free to give your opinions on the same.

Besides that, 15Rock looks like a great project and I appreciate the company's mission to focus on Climate risk management.

Thanks for the suggestion!!
That's fair and I understand your thinking. We do offer our free tier with the goal of not requiring the general public to require that upgrade. We have users all over the world who use the free tier to manage and engage with firms on climate risk.
The difference between the tiers is when it's used for commercial use which we need in order to fund our innovations and provide something useful to the general public(we aborb data and gpt4 costs for the public, thanks to commercial support from the professional investors who use our platform).
Either way we support your work and thought it would benift your users.
Appreciate the company's efforts in offering the free tier!
For the time being, I'll put it ""On Hold"" and add it to a public suggestions page on the Wiki. Will add a small description of the services available on the free tier.
This way people can find out about this platform if they check the suggestions page.
Will include it to Tools page when and if the criteria is expanded later on to include freemium platforms. This is solely to limit promotion in the Wiki.
Hope this is fair :)
Also, could you give a brief about the benefits of logging in (in the free tier)? Does the 5 companies limit exist even after logging in?
That’s totally fair and completely up to you. It was simply a suggestion to enhance your offering. Now that you know, we are out here and helping the general public as well, you can decide what’s best for your platform.
If you have any ideas or anything we can do to help then please do let us know. As we gain revenue to support it, We are constantly releasing new features and research to the public.
If someone logs in they get more companies(10 in total - note our competitors would charge 5k for what we give for free) and they can do portfolio analytics (which is exactly used by large institutional investors today). All free but to ensure we can support it, it’s for non commercial purposes only.
Great! Thanks for the info!!
As for now, I have no suggestions. The platform looks great. Has a neat UI and is easy to use.
Keep up the good work!!
Thank you so much. We want to do everything we can to help.
It's very challenging to balance the free tier with the paid tier. Without being paid, we cannot give tools for free, but many big investors (JP Morgan, MSCI, etc) all use our free tier without paying, so I get a lot of pressure to kill the free tier.
You beautiful SOB, this is fantastic. I think it’s great to have a straightforward, no BS public wiki for this. Everything in Sustainability and ESG is behind a paywall it feels, and having a one stop shop for people to get a basic grip of things is a great idea. Well done

Wiki Link
The website looks great, clean and no-nonsense. A few more suggestions- You can include a small introduction wiki to let a novice understand the flow and what re the beginners stuff he will need, much like a subreddit's wiki. Add the Introduction to ESG course by CFI institute. In Resources, you can add the reporting standards like ISO, GRI. Also add another link on upcoming areas, carbon credits, international projects. You can also add another section on interesting papers or recent reports which are informative and are scope for learning.
Those are some excellent suggestions!!
I did consider the course by CFI but decided to restrict the Courses to those provided by IGOs and Standard setters. Was concerned it would open the floodgates to all the independent courses available online.
But now, after some reconsideration I think we could expand it to include officially accredited Courses as well. Before doing that we'll have to set some criteria on what can be considered as officially accredited.
A lot of work needs to be done to improve and add to the Wiki.
I posted a detailed post giving more information about the Wiki and how people can contribute. But it was removed. I think it might be violating a subreddit rule.
This is a personal project of mine and my aim is to make it open sourced. There is no self promotion on the Wiki and no monetary gain for me from doing this.

Advice on getting finance role in Sustainable finance,"As the title states, I’m looking to break into sustainable finance. For context,I’m currently pursuing an MS in finance and analytics and have a general understanding of areas like impact investing, solar, etc. but I’m a bit lost when it comes to getting legitimate experience or a full-time role in any of these areas. Have any of you used resources aside from the CRA ESG course or specific courses during school to gain exposure?
Also, if there are any companies that have finance roles in the sustainability and/or sustainable energy space, I’d love to know about them.
Thanks for the help!","I'm in NYC and started in banking in an energy group - it was more broad including gas / coal / oil, but also a renewables vertical. From there I worked with a recruiter to get a renewable energy specific job (strategic M&A at a developer).
There are other ways - you can start in consulting, you can start at energy firms specifically. The energy industry is huge and people love to network.
Where do you live? I think a lot of this stuff is country-specific. If you're here in Canada, I know that this program from Concordia is one of the best.
My best advice is to not look for a job is sustainable finance, but to look for a job in finance and then bring sustainability to it. Too many mid-career professionals that are looking to pivot into sustainability such that you end up competing with over-qualified people for entry-level positions.
ESG is everywhere, so my advice is to find an organization that's a good fit for your first job out of school. Good pay, good leadership, and a stepping stone to where you want to end up. If you become the sustainability person within your team and keep learning, opportunities will find you. Hope this helped!
Thanks, I appreciate your insight. I’m currently in Los Angeles and intend to stay in the area. It’s been a bit of a struggle considering the current job market but finding a solid company and a solid role will be my main priority.
Yes, just get your foot in the door with anything involving finance and you can always jump ship later.
I found this list of different ESG certificates in the US that might be helpful. To me, it looks like the CFA one is the best, especially with a background in analytics. Check out this AMA someone did in r/CFA, it might be useful for you.
I'll note that this certificate will put you on a good path to being an ESG analyst, but might not be so useful for impact investing or solar. For those, I'd focus more on sustainable development (for impact measurements) or financial modeling (the whole solar industry is based on ROI models). So it kinda depends where you want to end up.

On one hand, yes, ESG is becoming the dominant narrative surrounding sustainable investments. On the other, we know that ESGs are tradable commodity. They are criteria which have been imposed on the industry within itself so in terms of positive environmental change, I remain sceptical.

Hi mouchys20. Thanks for sharing your thaughts on this. I think the whole wave has to start somewhere.

Opinions on Carbon Offsets,"What do people think of Carbon Offsets here? There were a bunch of stories about them in the news, but Govts and big Companies are going ahead with them. Curious to hear your thoughts.","Company offsetting is usually greenwashing BS. If you’re interested in offsetting personal emissions you can go through legitimate websites to do it. www.weareoffsetters.co.uk is an interesting one that actually offers you the opportunity to EXTRACT emissions as well as purchase real offsets
Im not a fan. It’s just an easy way for companies to “write off” their negative impact without actually doing the work. It can also be incredibly misleading to stakeholders. For example, Google claims it’s been carbon neutral since 2007. That’s a pretty remarkable statement given that not many were discussing emissions during that time. But if you check their reports it’s all from offsets/RECs.
When you really think about it, it’s hard to scientifically believe how the emissions of a Fortune 500 in New York correlate to the Amazon Rain Forest. There are more direct actions they could take within their supply chain and even locally that would have a larger offset impact. But that takes time, strategy, and money.
Offsets can be beneficial if it aligns with the company’s activities or is geographically reasonable. I also think they are a good addition to direct impact, but not the sole activity.
If you're asking about the offsets themselves, I'd say it depends on the specific carbon credits being purchased. Some are good, some are bad. You judge the quality of the offset on the scientific and ethical rigour of the individual project.
If you're asking about the offsets markets, I'd say its a mess. The voluntary carbon market is almost entirely self-regulated, i.e. its a free-for-all. It badly needs oversight.
If you're asking about the impact of offsets on the transition to net-zero, I would also say they are a negative influence. They're a distraction from the need for real, deep decarbonization, and too often firms decide to rely on them because the majority of other firms are as well.
Ultimately, I think people and firms get seduced by the low cost, low effort option of offsets. The voluntary market needs serious reform and regulation to make it a serious choice for firms looking to lower their impact on climate change. My advice is look at the work being done by the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) - they're cracking on with getting offsets into a better place.
I think they are a useful temporary measure. It's the lowest form of 'improving' an emissions profile, but it can be helpful to get some companies moving. It certainly shouldn't be the focus of an emissions strategy, but I don't think it's greenwashing every time they are part of the strategy. I think the key here is that they need to be temporary while real solutions are focused on.
Agreed with the commenter above. They're a ton of hogwash to make companies feel good about themselves.

A Useful Framework For The Distributed Climate Revolution,"Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) offer new opportunities for decentralized funding for climate action 🌍. A DAO is a decentralized, blockchain-based organization that operates through self-executing smart contracts and independent decision-making by members. An increasing number of them are fundraising in the carbon credit and Regenerative Finance (ReFi) niche.
However, when we have around 4000 days to decarbonize the global economy massively and when greenwashing is unveiled, being rigorous is crucial.
To ensure their effectiveness, DAOs must improve on developing and implementing transparent monitoring, evaluation, and learning.
This is known as:
This is a framework already used by global climate philanthropy that helps create trust in the ecosystem when tailored appropriately to the organization’s or project’s purpose.
Monitoring refers to the routine monitoring of project resources, activities, results, and information analysis to guide project implementation.
Evaluation is the periodic (mid-term, final) assessment and analysis of an ongoing or completed project.
Learning involves reflecting on monitoring and evaluating results to improve a project’s ability to achieve its intended results. DAOs can develop best practices and improve project designs by evaluating project outcomes and learning from the results.
One of the main challenges for the massive adoption of DAOs is the cryptoterribled reputation.
To avoid concerns about the transparency and accountability of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that work in climate change, developing more robust MEL frameworks is essential.
🔍To build trust among stakeholders, DAOs must prioritize integrating transparent and accountable MEL frameworks into their climate action projects 👀.",,2 months ago,"['Mon, Feb 27, 2023, 09:03:10 PM Central European Standard Time']",General Resource
Biggest European lender to Canada's oil sands calls it quits.

Really only China is building new plants at meaning scale and they don’t need Western finance.
India could be an option but outside of that where is there enough new coal to make a business?
Barclays does not have the courage to defend its own irresponsible convictions. It is backing away from tar sands because it's unseemly to continue financing the ""worst of the worst"". But even for the oil sands industry, most of the financial risk comes from what it will take to transition away from fossil fuels -- government policy action as well as competition from renewable energy, destroying the market for tar sands oil. Coal is so far down this road already that it has barely been given a reprieve by the spike in fossil fuel prices due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",2 months ago,"['Sun, Feb 26, 2023, 09:24:16 PM Central European Standard Time']",Breaking News

I would really appreciate help. Thank you all in advance! Google form Link","I finished the survey, but I agree you need some free forms in there or at least 1 at the very bottom. I wanted to explain that while I believe it has started affecting business, the rate of change is not fast enough. That most people are shallowly aware but won’t retrospective what they can change or are not willing to make changes to their habits (Amazon shopping, plant-based eating, plastic-free, riskier/slower investment returns, not go with the highest reward card, etc).
Also, brainstorming on this sub is great, but you know that the results will be skewed, right?
I think instead of a survey, you should use market research. Sustainability hasnt become a household term, and most people wont know wtf you're talking about. (I'm assuming this survey will be for randoms). For a thesis, getting University R&D data or even looking into ESG reporting firms that specialize in finance would hold much more weight. Proof.io is one of them. Good luck!

Nonetheless, a reason why I would suggest a seperate sign up flow before setting up a portfolio is being able to capture prospective customer's details quickly so that if they become uninterested whilst filling out the survey and exit, you'll still be able to track that flow and reach out to them to find out why you lost them
Going through a sign up sort of feels gratifying too before having to actually use my brain to think about the questions asked haha.

Barriers to transition,What are some barriers to a clean energy transition for SMEs?,"Clean energy is overwhelmingly a capital intensive business. Wind and solar require a huge up front investment and provide bond-like returns.
Smaller companies can develop projects but typically have to exit at financial close (pre-construction)
Energy storage whether batteries or hydrogen tend to be both capital intensive and risky.
Some battery applications and lithium ion are basically proven, but have limited growth and can become capital instead and low return.
Hydrogen has been around as a concept for 50 years. Who knows what will happen but participating in the market requires technology, understanding of regulations, and probably government relations.
Almost all clean energy is regulation driven. Companies and investors have to be able to understand and perhaps influence rules.
Lots of businesses are not inherently suited to SMEs and a large portion of clean energy meets that criteria, especially at the smaller end of SME

1 Tip For People Getting Into Sustainable Finance Reporting To Boost A Quick Understanding of The Field,"Climate finance can be challenging with so many players involved.
As global temperatures rise, investors demand climate disclosures, leading to a proliferation of complex reporting systems and acronyms. At the academic center where I work, we specialize in helping companies effectively report on their climate finance initiatives.
So, here is my main tip for those entering this field:
Grouping organizations into two main groups will streamline your ability to learn.
The sustainability reporting field can broadly be categorized into two main approaches: standards and frameworks. Of course, the world is not entirely black and white, as some organizations tend to do both, and there’s also rankings.
Standards and Frameworks

Source: https://www.globalreporting.org/media/jxkgrggd/gri-perspective-esg-standards-frameworks.pdf
Standards are the agreed quality requirements for reports.
Think of them as a guide, outlining what needs to be reported on each topic with specific criteria and metrics. You might have heard of some of the big players in the game, like GRI, ISSB, and Value Reporting Foundation.
Think of them as the trusty maps of sustainability.
They provide context and guidance on thinking about a topic but don’t have specific reporting obligations. . Frameworks allow for flexibility in defining the direction but not the method itself. Examples include TCFD, CDP, and Finance UNEP Initiative.
When standards aren’t around, frameworks step in to save the day!
In conclusion, understanding the difference between frameworks and standards is the first step to navigating the alphabet soup of the financial standards world!",,u/[deleted],[],

"For those who are thinking about taking CESGA, DON’T.","just shared this on an older post on CESGA, thought it deserves its own post for those innocent ones who are doing a quick Google research.
Here’s the rant,
How possibly is this not considered as a scam? The course content is, to put it lightly, poorly prepared at best. I was scammed £1500 and whoever sees this, please don’t throw your £1500 into water.
They claim they have an academic supervisor. Then this academic supervisor is either unable to perform basic quality control supervision of his/her own content, or is confident enough that none of its customer will do anything about it.
So much wrong about this programme, to name few,
I am disappointed. This is just a terrible look for ESG industry and reinforces the already existing stereotypes: everything in ESG is a scam and people in this industry are just trying to cash out and get the f out.
Don’t, ever, put, your, money, there. You had enough red flags from an internet stranger.
And for those who already paid for it, we should definitely gang up and sue the organization to get our money back. Or least warn the governmental authority about this.","Our company gives us the opportunity to participate in one of the two offers for ESG certification. Alternatively to CESGA we are able to select https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/programs/esg-investing the CFA ESG certification. The feedback of the colleagues so far are: CFA is less European focused(?) The CESGA do ask at the exam next to theoretical knowledge, business cases e.g. analyzing a Bond to buy, where the issues bares obvious ESG risks. You should evaluate the bond price and estimate if the spread is fairly priced. So I do think that you need a decent amount of prior financial knowledge to be able to make such estimations. BOTH Programms are developed to earn a good money for the certification institute. Anyway as it gets more and more mandatory that portfolio managers get a ESG certification, they will continue make money even with poor content.
Do you really feel there is truly no value from a business perspective? Did you learn no additional insights? Or do you feel that employers do not receive this certificate as worthy/interesting to have?
Or are you majorly frustrated that you paid for something with poor quality (I have been there and empathize with you - that sucks). However, my company is willing to pay, and I thought this could be a decent certification to show on my resume (and hopefully learn something in the process). How long did you study for this exam, and I assume you passed?
Thanks for your insights, and sorry for your poor experience. That sucks. I am considering the CFA ESG one, but I have to be at a location for this that is not where I live, so additional costs I would have to incur. Because my firm would not pay for that. just the exam and materials. Thanks again!
Hi there. It might be worthwhile if you are looking from a business perspective. As some redditors mentioned previously, CESGA is probably the only employer recognized and viable option on the market.
As for additional insight, the content itself is quite diverse and covers a lot of topics. But it doesn’t change the fact that the content itself was shallow and ill-structured. You will probably have a better experience watching some YouTube videos explaining these concepts to you than sitting through the nearly 20 hours terribly organized dull PowerPoint reading.
And yes, I passed the exam, and I was mainly upset about the gap between the money I pay and what I got. If someone else’s paying it for you, then sure, why not take the opportunity?
For preparing the exam, EFFAS recommends 80-120 hours, but it definitely took me less than that. I’d say around 60 hrs depending on how much experience you have In the field.
Thanks for sharing. This is helpful context!
Well I have already signed up for the March test. Agree on poor design of the materials and the website access. Does it matter to prospective employers? Probably not.
Until CESGA has a recognised competitor, I don't see them improving any time soon.
I am thinking of taking it because my company is willing to pay for it, and it's a certification for ESG. Coming from the RE side people love this, so I think having some certification may be better than nothing. How long have you been preparing for the exam?

Career “Transition” into sustainable finance,"I (23) say “transition” because it’s a completely different department I’d be working in but the same field. Trying to get out of sustainable communications and into sustainable finance within the fashion industry. I’m very passionate about sustainable fashion particularly in the luxury retail space.
For some context here’s my background: I went to a technical highschool and studied accounting and finance. In college I double majored in international business and marketing and double minored in accounting and fashion studies. Around sophomore year my college introduced a sustainability study, so I dropped accounting and added sustainability as my new minor. I felt like I had a good grasp of accounting basics that would help with my personal finances, plus the international business major touched on economics and I was more passionate about fashion and the environment.
Fast forward, I graduate from college during the pandemic and have only landed jobs in communications and marketing. I still stick with my passion and only work for BCorp businesses and nonprofits. But I’m incredibly unhappy and miserable. I try applying for roles more focused on creating and executing sustainable strategies but there are barely any entry level positions and my resume screams comms. So, I decided to get my masters.
Right now I am in the Sustainability Management program at Columbia. I really like the courses offered and I wanted to leverage the Ivy League name since I went to a much smaller college for my undergrad.
Anyway, I finished my first semester in the fall with a 4.0 GPA. One of the classes I took was on accounting and finance for sustainable investments. It touched on making statements, valuation, and modeling. It was incredibly challenging but my accounting skills came back to me and I actually found the class to be very rewarding. So much so that’s it’s sparked my interest in choosing that as my career path. Furthermore, after looking more into sustainable fashion jobs descriptions and checking out CSO LinkedIn pages I’m seeing a lot of financial reporting involved with the roles.
This is equally exciting but also intimidating because again, right now my professional history has only been marketing and comms. I’ve been looking for some MBA finance internships for summer 2023 but those are looking for people that have some finance experience under their belt.
I feel like I’m stuck in some purgatory where I have some skill but not enough. I know finance is no joke, but I really need to get out of the career I am currently in and I really enjoy the challenge finance brings me. Any advice on how I can make myself a better candidate, are there certain certifications I should look into getting?
Actions Im taking: Taking GHG Emissions accounting this upcoming semester and Corporate Reporting the next. Also applying to finance and sustainability summer internships in fashion and consumer goods like crazy with follow ups to recruiters.
TLDR: Wanting to transition from sustainable communications to sustainable finance in the fashion industry. Has some prior knowledge in accounting and currently in sustainability masters program but professional experience is only in communications. Need advice on how to make resume more desired for finance roles/internships.","I've worked in both sustainable fashion and sustainable finance, but not at the same time. You're looking for quite a niche role if you want to do sustainable accounting for a sustainable fashion company. It might be better to focus on one of those areas first and build up experience in one before trying to bridge to the other.
I agree, I’ve applied for internships in both spaces and will focus on whichever one I land on. Since most of my background is in fashion I’m working on building my finance skills in school. Also, I have found and applied to finance internships for fashion companies that have a sustainability department. I know it’s a stretch but I can see a pathway.
Few questions for you: What did you do in sustainable fashion? Are you still working the sus finance route? Which do you enjoy the most and why?
I worked for 4 years on impact reporting in organic cotton projects for an organisation that connects smallholder organic cotton farmers with large brands and retailers.
I started work in sustainable finance 6 months ago and currently very much enjoying it. Plan to stay on this sector for the foreseeable future.
I've enjoyed both roles and it's hard to say which I prefer more. The main reason I left my previous role was the limited opportunities to personally develop myself in a relatively small organisation. Now working at a large multinational bank there are far more opportunities to learn and develop new skills and a better chance of career progression overall.
sorry for jumping in. do you mind to share what is your educational background to support your work in impact reporting area? Any certification did you take?
Sure. I have a BSc in environmental sciences (predominantly focused on palaeoclimatology, biodiversity and ecology) and a MSc in in climatology and ecology.
I didn't take any certifications to get into impact reporting. I suppose I am very detail orientated with strong skills in excel and python which allows me to handle reasonable quantities of data and process them efficiently.
I have a finance degree and pursed sustainable finance. I work in sales, but did a practicum at an investment management firm where we would value companies and incorporate ESG into our investment decisions. I HATED it. But I’m happy to answer any questions if you want to send me a PM :)

ESG practises could also mean excluding businesses from certain industries or those that, in the fund manager's opinion, have performed poorly in terms of managing ESG risks and opportunities.

Pricing ESG incentives into Small & Medium enterprize bank debt margins. Why not?,"The ESG conversation is to focussed on driving better allocation of capital (equity) through investment decisions based on ESG disclosures. But is this 'top down' approach that targets the big-end of town [public/listed entities] missing [and in the process letting off the hook] a huge cohort of small to medium sized companies from playing their part? Where is the conversation on focussing on the bottom up small-end of town businesses? What an opportunity this is!
I'm looking for people interested in the discussion on bank provided debt capital?
[actually, not people interested in discussing but building something specifically for this space].
*****************
When was the last time you were asked whether you would like to invest in that new oil project or coal mine, or choose to source your supply chain from a non-ESG-compliant cheap offshore supplier? I didn't think so - few people have that power.
But how many of you know a small business owner? Friend of a friend who owns a medium sized business? Your own business? The mate who is the key decision maker/CFO/board advisor or accountant to that business? A distant uncle who has a very successful big business? I guarantee none of them are on the radar of those fund managers looking for ESG friendly allocation of equity capital, but know each on of them uses a bank for their financing needs for which more often than not will include debt financing via their bank or banks.

But more importantly - they are nimble. No committees, AGMs, sub-committees with external consultants to recommend something to the work group that will present to the board for a vote. No. SMEs can and will make rational choices if provided an economic benefit. They don't receive any 'soft' benefits aspoused in the ESG articles on market rewarding the good global citizens via the equity markets as they aren't listed. And in my dealing with this cohort of successful business owners and wealthy family groups - they worked hard to get there by being commercial and smart and aren't about to become a charity. They are not big enough to be captured under emitting laws or disclosure regulations and not interested in yielding to the will of climate activism. No one tells them how to run their businesses least of all 'woke youth who haven't built a business nor know the value of a hard earned dollar'!
But this cohort is decisive, free from red-tape, results driven and quicker to change than their institutional counterparts. They are unaffected by investment allocation theory/practice but very much dependent on the banking sector and incentivised by their hip pocket (as we all are). But they can make big changes if shown the way.
Fortunately here is a direct mechanism to incentivise ESG behavours via their bank-funding margins. Provide the incentive and they will. Provide a cost and they will. And they need DEBT capital to stay in business and grow. And banks are a) governed by Basel Capital frameworks and b) responding to the investment allocation as intended.

Connect the dots and you realise we need to solve for this tranmission mechanism:
Pricing ESG incentives into Small & Medium enterprize bank debt margins.","You are touching an important issue, and as you point out, still a largely ignored one. Its no surprise. All major current economies are in love with market concentration and megacorps. Correspondingly, policy and regulation tend to focus on the largest actors (using the Pareto 20/80 principle) and SME's are in general a side note. ""Proportionality"" arguments, data and capacity issues etc. are invoked to justify this first/second class economic actor approach.
Yet historically small businesses are the backbone and ground state of economic organization, not the exception. The sustainability discussion (and the sustainable financing of economic activity) asks us to think beyond current market shape particulars. Embedding incentives and costs in a bottom-up fashion (starting with the smallest business units) automatically solves the issues also at the aggregate level but the opposite is not true: a large corp will have to devise internally a top-down method to attribute impact, costs etc to various business lines. That is a tricky and controversial process even for elementary funds transfer pricing.
Banks could substract a ""greenium spread"" if they can finance SME portfolios more attractively but the existence and stability of such a spread is currently not obvious. See e.g. a recent working paper by ECB economists [1]
Or they could charge a ""brown discount"" to cover (putative) increased capital costs from the financing. But this is also a difficult discussion. Bank ESG risks are generally long term and attract no regulatory capital. They are more a reputation risk than anything else at this point. Increased bank disclosure may create a green-brown stratification of bank funding costs but this might be hard to separate from other firm-specific risk factors.
[1] https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/ecbecbwps/20222728.htm
Isn't the SME-ESG integration problem largely one of data and capacity?
Even if the financial mechanisms are in place, most of the SMEs I work with simply don't have the capacity in terms of human resource or data to make ESG-qualified judgements, let alone disclosures, half of the time.
The end result is often falling back onto sector based decision making, which in my opinion is universally stupid, or half-arsing an esg profile.
I'd like to see a highly streamlined (re: cheap) system for comparable esg related data gathring that works for SMEs first, before I would pin any financial decision making on it.... even SME dedicated disclose programs like the DNK or ecovadis are a stretch for many SMEs
Couldn't agree more with you u/phil_style.
Too hard, too costly, too few resources. More often than not this ""function"" would be lumped on the CFO/Finance director and if they are fortunate enough to have a small team (Accounts payable/accounts receivable) it will likely end up another ghastly spreadsheet no one knows how it works.

This is largely a data problem - but where is the impetus for a SME to act?
In the same way the large end of town has the equity markets reward/penalty/discount mechanism, or the inflow/avoidance of investment funds - SMEs don't. Yet.
There needs to be a tangible economic incentive to overcome this data/capacity challenges to mobilise this huge dormant sector that can really make a difference to our global challenge.
In the absence of the BIS imposing punitive capital requirements via Basel regulations (the stick - and an effective one at that!), I see the market solution being to find the carrot. And since SMEs capital providers aren't the equity markets or funds, then bank debt pricing [I believe] could be the transfer mechanism.
SME financial decision maker (CFO/FD/owner) should be presented with the choice: ""do nothing: pay a small increase on bank loan margin, or do something (and associated cost/effort) and receive a progressive discount on your loan margin.""
How much, how to track, how to do etc open to ideas. But my general idea is too few will do the right thing 'out of the goodness of their hearts [cynical...yes, but rational as well?] but a well planned system should drive the right outcomes.
And on that note - when it comes to incurring ESG related disclosure and greening transition costs - who should pay? Or who do we want to pay?
The busines owner? The family shareholders behind it? The retirement nest egg or business equity they have built up?
The bank? Via providing discounts to their bank margins (bank revenues) ultimately decreasing their returns on equity for the bank shareholders?

A finance degree is absolutely worth it, but you also need to have a solid understanding on accounting, have great communication skills --verbal and written-- and be likable (or just do a lot of networking early on). I can confirm that the CFAi L1 curriculum will help with finance concepts. L2 will help with valuation specific concepts. You can skip L3 if you plan to be a banker for life; I do not, so I continued to finish it out.

Just be ready to work hard, bitch work included.
You're going to want to target being CFA qualified,.in order to improve your chances competing in the job market.
Accounting degree is going to be the most likely going to give you the best chance.
Warning, quite techmical and too mathy for some people.
A finance degree can often bee too generic, depending on the specific course.
Can't go wrong with accounting, but level 1 of the CFA is primarily material that can be learned from undergrad economics and finance degrees.
I'd suggest focusing on joining investment clubs that have IBs or PE firms would recruit through the university. Best of luck.",5 months ago,"['Thu, Dec 15, 2022, 03:43:51 PM Central European Standard Time']",Off-Topic

ESG questions for conference,Hi everyone. I am going to an ESG conference tomorrow and was wondering what are some really good questions I could ask some ESG professionals. I am trying to pivot my career towards corporate sustainability and am trying to get into the field so attending this conference is a good chance to network. I am nervous about the whole networking thing so I wanted some good questions to provide for some talking points. I have a couple in mind that I am genuinely curious about but if anyone had some questions that would really blow someone out of the ballpark that would be great. Thanks!,"As much as you want to ask impressive questions, you need to be able to understand the answer and follow it up with an actual conversation… i would not recommend asking a question on a topic you barely know anything about.
Esg is quite vast. So maybe « how did you get into esg » and « where do you see most development/needs for esg carreers ?» would he a good way to start.
What conference are you attending?
I'm not exactly sure of your background, but perhaps you could ask them about the current state of ESG data and ratings, whereby for the same company, there could be multiple contradicting ESG ratings. Instead, would it be better to have a encyclopedia of ESG raw data instead, whereby anyone can use that data for their own discretion/algorithm to decide on a corporate's ESG situation? Something like a Wikipedia whereby every company has their own profile, but in this case maybe something like ESGpedia, whereby every company has their own ESG corporate profile?
Can you give some more context on what kind of ESG conference are you attending? ESG is an extremely broad topic and covers many grounds. I think if your questions revolves around the main theme of the conference you should be okay.",5 months ago,"['Thu, Dec 08, 2022, 03:52:03 PM Central European Standard Time']",Discussion / Question

What do you mean exactly? Due to it being a consultancy we do everything, typically for companies in the early stage of ESG development.
I guess are you doing financial analysis, ghg accounting, etc. I'm wondering how to get into it with a minimal ghg quantification background and more environmental policy background. Any recs of companies to look at? Also pm west coast
We do all of it. Since it is such a new expertise it is unlikely you’ll find someone that has seven years experience in ESG specifically, rather they come in with other sustainability experience. I would suggest looking at consultancies as you can be put on ESG projects to gain more experience where you lack. I’d look at top tier ones if you have a masters from a competitive school, otherwise I’d recommend getting your foot in the door for corporate sustainability and evaluate if a masters is right for you. (I wouldn’t have had nearly the same career growth without it).
Thank you! Can I ask what your education and work history is, and salary? I don't have a masters. Am wondering if a masters in sustainability will lead to significant salary growth. I'm coming from an environmental and urban planning background with a bachelor's from a top school for this field but not a great GPA. 7 years working experience mostly in municipal planning but also environmental consulting. The early part of that was working on ghg emission verification. In hindsight I wish I stayed on that path because it seems a lot more lucrative than the one I'm on.
I'm making 100k in the sf bay area. Trying to get to 150 because this place is insane.
BSc in environmental economics, MSc in environmental modeling & management. Work history touches on mainly green building, operational sustainability, and ghg emissions calculating, reporting, and reduction strategies. Everyone I’ve worked with/for at competitive NGO’s and consultancies have had a masters. I make $140k which will likely increase at least $40k in the next couple years.
Gotcha. Do you think an MPA with a focus on sustainability would be good for this field?
Unless you want to stay in policy, I wouldn’t do an MPA. If you want to do corporate sustainability then a more technical degree would be better. Some type of MSc in sustainability would be your best bet.

Outside of sustainability BofA is also a bitch about overdraft fees and stuff and they charged me like $40 to get more checks—the original checkbox from when I opened my account lasted me about 10 years and I think I accidentally threw away like half of them. I opened an account with sofi and they send me like a normal amount of checks for free as I need them and it’s like actually free checking and my account probably earned more interest in a month than I earned in a decade combined at BofA

MSc Finance or MSc International Business and Economics - Sustainable Finance,"Hey All!
I've been looking into two masters programs:
1.) MSc Finance in Sustainable Finance
2.) MSc International Business and Economics in Sustainable Finance and Investments
Wondering what your opinions are on the better route to take? The MSc Fin looks to be focused on general finance topics before relating it to sustainable finance. The MSc Ibus looks to teach the finance topics alongside sustainable finance ideas, as well as two courses in economics.
I got my Bachelor degree in Finance and I want to shape my career in Sustainable Finance. I love finance but don't necessarily see myself crunching numbers at a desk the rest of my life as an analyst. My instinct is that the MSc Fin would provide a stronger background moving forward and kickstarting my career.
As for prestige of the schools, the MSc Fin is ranked higher in business, while the MSc Ibus is ranked higher overall. Further, the location of the MSc Ibus is more attractive to me than the MSc Fin... How much weight does the degree title and prestige carry?

Bro I’m studying MSc in Sustainable Finance and FinTech. Amazing. We deal with everything. However, the top would be Climate Change and Finance at Imperial’s college, London.
I'm curious to hear more about your experience. DM kindly? I sent you a message.
Thanks! Glad to hear you’re enjoying it. Problem is, I’m looking at the Netherlands where it’ll only cost me €2300. Don’t think I could stomach the high costs elsewhere with my already accumulated Bachelors debt…
I’d go with option two based on the information you’ve provided.
You’ve already made good points on why option two is the better than option one. Moreover, in my opinion, having sustainable finance with some investing major/minor would be more beneficial from a degree perspective.
However, besides the information you’ve provided, I’d check to see what subjects are included in each of the options. Like what exactly will you be learning sustainability wise in each option? It may be labelled sustainable finance, but will the masters degree be like most with respect to 80% of the courses being comprised of finance courses, and if you’re lucky, 20% of course will be sustainable finance related.
Also, not knowing that much about your background, as in, have you just finished your bachelors degree or have or you currently working within finance? I ask this as it might be worth rethinking/questioning why you want to pursue a masters degree in the first place?
If you’re currently working, why not pursue a certification in sustainable finance instead? There are plenty of options out there. Moreover, it would be a lot cheaper (assuming you’re from a country that you need to pay for post-grad education), less time consuming, focused 100% on sustainable topics, and the teaching approach is primarily practical/real world topics/content rather than the theory dominated aspect most universities courses entail.
Just a few thoughts to think about from someone who’s looking to pivot from corporate treasury into sustainable finance myself.
Disclaimer: I have completed a Masters degree in Finance. I did this degree in Finland where it’s “free” (Originally from Australia), and I am currently studying the CESGA program which I am personally enjoying. The course could be better, but overall it gives a nice overall picture of the sustainability issues and work currently being done in sustainable investing/finance in Europe (Portfolio management focus)
Thanks for the great reply! I’m in my last year of my undergrad while working full-time in an entry level due-diligence role. I would love to be involved in Sustainable Finance when I get a more reputable finance job, so thought a masters in the subject would be a great kickstart.

ESG Is Not Impact Investing and Impact Investing Is Not ESG,,"As someone who has been working in environmental and social management in the mining industry for 25 years (sigh – I am that old), I find I oscillate between annoyance and bewilderment when people talk about the differences in ESG, Sustainability and now Impact investing. I’m in the unusual position of having my professional discipline being rebranded by an industry that understands very little about the practicalities of my profession – only the financial impacts of getting things wrong.
The bottom line is that regardless of what you want to name it ESG/sustainability/Impact etc the end goal is the same. Investors want to think that the company or portfolio they have put their money in is not contributing to the long-term environmental and social decline of the world we live in. Don’t get caught up in semantics – it doesn’t matter. What matters is that we understand the real-world impact of all industries and we are ensuring that organizations are at the very least taking responsibility for their overall footprint.
What do you thing the future of impact investing is given the accusations of greenwashing surrounding ESG?
It took more than a century for classic financial and credit analysis to mature and it still can go terribly pear-shaped when everybody closes their eyes and start blowing bubbles (like the 2008+ crisis)
Sustainable finance doesnt have a century to develop. It will have to go through the ups and downs at an accelerated pace and hopefully the trend will be a net positive...
Interesting take. How do you differentiate classical finance from sustainable finance? To me, sustainable finance is just the application of “classical” finance to a specific strategy.
Do you make a distinction between impact investing and sustainable finance?
the story of the blind people touching different parts of an elephant and disagreeing about what sort of animal it is seems quite appropriate in the current stage of ""sustainable finance""
the core reality is that the classical financial system incentivizes and facilitates economic behavior by translating everything into nominal monetary units. It is a one-dimensional map (more money=good, less money=bad) which is extremely practical, low cognitive load, and arguably has enabled the flourishing of human economies. But it has reached its limit on several fronts, both social and environmental. Its virtue of not having to micromanage individual choices and behaviors becomes a liability when those choices are collectively ruining the very system.
Now, facing this crude but ubiquitous setup some people choose to do the ""right thing"" according to their values (and then we call it ""impact investing""). But increasingly society at large realizes we might have a more serious and existential problem. This forces public sector entities to try to use legal, regulatory and tax tools to channel people into ""the right thing"" (and we call it ESG). The idea is to re-interpret sustainability as a monetary value, through e.g., the cost of doing business or risk capital.
In this picture greenwashing is in principle similar to well known pathological responses to government attempts to use legal, regulatory and tax to ""fix"" weaknesses of the system: illicit trade, tax evasion, regulatory arbitrage etc etc. People will on average cling to optimizing the only metric of value and worth that is widely recognized, the only way ""to pay the bills"" - and you cannot entirely fault them for that.
I think the societal stress of worshiping two diverging gods will eventually become unbearable. In the fullness of time (and hopefully sooner than later) all these ""non-financial"" pieces of the puzzle will start merging with the financial/monetary dimension and eventually finance, investment etc will be sustainable by default...
Thanks for the well thought response. It’s an interesting perspective and I would widely agree. It makes sense to me to try to translate the social and environmental good to money because we don’t have a better measure. Or do we?
Indeed, currently we don't. We have ideas and proposals at different stages of maturity (triple bottom lines, natural and social capitals, multi-objective optimization that takes into account tangible sustainability metrics etc etc).
But all this is a far cry from the simplicity and versatility of putting a monetary price tag on all things and optimizing on that.
Huge amounts of regulation are being developed to fight greenwashing … future looks very bright and transparent as far as I’m concerned.
What makes you think greenwashing in ESG could jeopardise the future of impact investing anyway?
Thanks for the response! Nice to see some discussion in this subreddit!
I'm not saying I think it would be jeopardised but when I speak to people in the financial services industry, they know ESG but they don't know impact. The first thing people ask is how will impact investing address the concerns of greenwashing.
My view is that impact investing isn't here to fix problems in ESG. It's objective are different - I like how this article lays it out. My question really is, do we think the general investing population will understand impact investing or will ESG always overshadow it since the greenwashing topic is always in the forefront of the conversation?
Ah I see what you mean!
Yes, impact investing is indeed a very different thing from ESG, and agree that people who are new to the space/uneducated often do not know the difference.
impact investing being the large scale funnelling of capital specifically towards solving important problems e.g. UN SDG's, climate change, biodiversity loss, the list is endless., often (but not always) through innovative new technologies and companies, generally with large growth potential.
Whereas 'ESG' investing is about looking at existing funds and companies and assessing them for how well they integrate environmental, social and governance concerns into their policies and risk management strategies, along virtually any line of business. You can even compare coal mining companies on their ESG credentials - which says a lot about how far ESG is from impact investing!
I am of the belief that anybody with enough funds to make a significant difference in impact investing is already educated, or will be within the next couple of years at most. There is simply too much money to be made in impact investment to disregard it, and that opportunity is the real reason most participants are in the space.

ESG career pivot,"Hi everyone,
I wanted some advice on how to pivot into an ESG career. For context, I graduated from college in May with a degree in Environmental Science and Policy as an environmental economics major. A lot of my classes were heavily dependent on business/economics, law, and sustainability. For some ungodly reason, in my college senior year I decided that I wanted to gain more experience with actual environmental science like field and lab work. Fast forward to today and I have had 2 internships and a current state job that involves the outdoors, science, and field work. I have realized that this is not the route for me, and it brought back all the reasons that I decided to go the more business path in college in the first place- better compensation, better work hours, not being exposed to hazardous chemicals and dangerous circumstances on the daily. I have been writing a bunch of annual reports at my current job that have to do with the environmental data we find and sustainability (?) but apart from my economics classes and some research, I do not have much experience in ESG. With all that being said, what is the best way for someone like me to pivot into this career? I have been trying to get some online certifications with SQL ( I also have experience with RStudio) and would like to do the CFA ESG certification as well but that will probably have to be sometime in the future. I have been trying to find some entry level ESG jobs but can't seem to find many and I live near a somewhat big city on the east coast but it's definitely nowhere near as prominent of a financial district like say NYC. Are there tangential jobs that could help me transition into an ESG job in the future? I am honestly trying to leave my current environmental science job as soon as possible due to the fact that I feel like am behind.
","Some useful advice here but mainly for beginners. it is time-stamped...and a great list of resources in the video description...Worth following some of those influencers...https://youtu.be/N_0YaioUW3U
I work at one of the big 4 as an ESG consultant helping to advise financial services companies and governments on how to be more sustainable / how to report on their climate impacts etc etc .. very interesting and rapidly evolving line of work and I love it
I haven’t even finished my environmental science degree yet, but had worked in finance a few years before I made the switch.
Definitely a corner of the market to look at trying to apply to - Good luck!
Could I talk to you about this field? Interested myself
I definitely will be doing so. Thanks !!
To be blunt, CFA is the best route in to ESG/ finance, unless you can convince someone who does reputational risk related ESG. Insurers are a good bet, or the big banks. But these are head office fuxntiosn, so you are better off if you are located where the HQs are (London, Frankfurt, New York etc...)
Getting at least the CFA esg module does will give you the vocabulary need to talk shop in an interview.
Gotcha! Would you say obtaining the CFA would take one down a more ESG investing route? After doing some more research, I see that there are people who also so stuff on the corporate sustainability / ESG reporting side. I am also interested in this path as well. Would you happen to know if a CFA would assist one who were to focus more on reporting? Or is it exclusive to investing/finance?
If you want to go corporate sustainability then, instead of doing the CFA, get yourself some training in 1 or 2 of the following (in order of priority, IMo fom most to lower):
Where can I get training on the GHG Protocol?
Does it still make any sense provided that I have a legal background? (Law degree and financial law masters degree)
That is really helpful. Thanks a lot!
This is a good list, and if you can demonstrate familiarity and understanding of these, there’s a role for you in corporate ESG - I’d also recommend adding the S&P CSA, Science Based Targets initiative, and looking into upcoming SEC climate reporting mandates.",6 months ago,"['Thu, Nov 03, 2022, 06:04:07 PM Central European Standard Time']",Careers

A way to improve Climate disclosures,"We want to introduce everyone to the concept of Climate Accounting.
CPAs have a new responsibility to their clients and the planet. With a strong push from shareholders, customers, and the government, businesses must disclose their carbon footprint and all environmental impact data in the same level as their financial statements.
Climate accounting is more than just counting carbon for the sustainability department, it’s a tool for corporate financial teams to manage and control the risk exposure to carbon pricing across operations and its supply chain. Simply put carbon has a price, CPAs need to be involved and Climate accounting makes that possible. While ESG focuses on reactive measures to a company’s environmental impact, climate accounting is the proactive action of managing a company’s relationship to its supply chain and exposing risks to the rising prices of carbon.
With the incoming S.E.C climate disclosure, how a firm treats its exposure to carbon pricing has changed. Carbon emissions are no longer something we estimate and create vague reports about. It’s crucial that CPAs are aware of the price of carbon to help their clients avoid greenwashing and misspent investments. Climate Accounting gives finance teams the ability to manage the supply chain and its environmental impact. CPAs using climate accounting will provide more accurate and valuable consulting services. Guesswork and estimations are not sufficient for regulated climate disclosures. Lastly, CPAs have to keep a close eye on the assurance of these disclosures. There is an expectation that climate disclosures will have assurance practices applied in full. Climate accounting is accessible to all levels of an accounting firm as you don’t need specialized environmental knowledge to use the too.
We hope this knowledge is useful!

Sustainable Finance: A Regulatory Imperative for Financial Institutions,"Global summits, alarming climate change & sustainability reports and already visible effects of climate change have led to the rise of conscious consumerism throughout the world.
Regulators and supervisory authorities are also increasingly active to enforce regulatory guidance and mandates on financial institutions to nudge them towards sustainable alternatives.
Financial institutions(FIs) are finding themselves at the sustainability crossroads. The role of FIs, as significant agents for capital intermediation between investors and organisations, is extremely critical in the transition away from a fossil fuel-dominated economy. This transition has its own share of challenges such as differences in terminologies used across sectors and geographies and several unethical practices such as greenwashing, and insufficient ESG focus from board members and senior management. This has forced financial regulators, across the globe,  to introduce  various ESG mandates and guidance to ensure FIs begin to prioritise and embrace ESG imperatives.
In this post we take a closer look at some of the prominent measures undertaken by the regulatory authorities and policymakers in the G20 nations. Below is a categorisation of some of the prominent initiatives that is being implemented in the financial sector:
Nations can be further classified based on their responsiveness towards implementing sustainable finance guidance and mandates to the financial sector. Below exhibit captures the status of regulatory initiatives around sustainability in the G20 nations.📷
Sustainability Frontrunners:  European members stand out as one of the most proactive players in the race towards net zero. 
Active Implementers: This category includes  countries where central banks are  in the process of laying out  plans to counter  climate change   with an ever increasing emphasis on  green finance.  
Getting off the blocks: These include regions where the impact of  green finance is recognised, however establishing a formal framework is still under consideration or is at a nascent stage.
The stakes to embrace sustainability initiatives are high for FIs. The pull from the client-conscious customers and the push from supervisory authorities have set unavoidable and urgent imperatives for FIs to take decisive steps to move from a passive position to become active shapers of the green, sustainable future.

There Is No “C” in “ESG”: An Illustration of ESG’s Biggest Risk,,"ESG is a scam anyway
In a more polite way the author substantially agrees with you. He picked cyber security to show that people will link to ESG practically anything. Thats why he concludes: ""ESG’s own biggest risk may be that it can be whatever you want or need it to be.""
This is an irrelevance. If cyber-security is an issue then analyse it and assess that risk - nobody is stopping you and it doesn't have to be shoe-horned into ESG.
Cyber risk is actually evaluated in the S (social) Pilar of ESG, in relevant sectors.
Would make more sense under governance
I think his point is precisely that. If you follow the links in the article (especially the ""E"" part) the linkages to cybersecurity are very tenuous yet people will just talk vacuities.
That's why he concludes with: ""ESG’s own biggest risk may be that it can be whatever you want or need it to be.""
Yup. Let cyber risk be cyber risk.

Why is sustainable investing so hard?,"I have recently started investing. Opening the account was no problem. However, at several points I had the feeling that I was being overwhelmed by the amount of things I had to keep an eye on. Am I the only one? What are your experiences?","We created a site to help with the ethical investing side of things. You can compare stocks easily based on ESG metrics. People find it useful for basic needs - it's still early days but feel free to drop feature requests.

I would agree that sustainable investing is far too difficult today, but fortunately, there are companies working on making it easier.
For example, Carbon Collective is a robo-advisor that's simplifying the public equity/bond side of the equation. And, they recently launched an ETF for self-directed investors (CCSO). Green bond ETFs (GRNB) are another good way to make an impact. However, ESG/SRI ETFs and ratings are still a mess since there's no consensus.
There's also the private markets (e.g., Reg A/D crowdfunding). I recently put together a database of them (https://www.virtuevest.com/) to try and aggregate opportunities there since there's no central exchange. But unfortunately, those investments are generally illiquid/riskier and you're on your own when it comes to tracking and taxes. Some, like Energea, have a really well-organized back-end and provide tax docs though.
What do you mean?
So first of all the whole topic with financial terms, the amount of products on the market etc., which was very complicated for me in the beginning. Today this isn't my biggest issue anymore. I wonder if this is normal in the beginning and how you guys dealt with it. In addition, it is still difficult for me to see through which financial products are actually sustainable, or how sustainable my portfolio is. How do you deal with this?
Okay, let me start off by saying that I work in the industry so I'm coming at this from the opposite direction to you.
There's certainly a lot of jargon in the industry but nothing is too complicated once you break things down. Also, when speaking to salespeople, don't be afraid to ask for clarification/explanations. If they can't break things down into concepts that you understand then walk away and find someone who can. It's your money and you're taking the risks so you need to understand what they are.
I take it you know the differences between the main asset classes (stocks, bonds, property, commodities) and the difference between active and passively managed funds. If not then read up on those first.
In terms of sustainability, regulations are still developing and the industry is still debating many aspects of it. For example, it was generally accepted by most ESG-labelled funds that they shouldn't hold military suppliers. However, with Russia invading Ukraine, many of them have changed policy and allow it because ""defence"" is a societal positive now (I haven't changed policy but I can see their point).
The best way for you to approach it is to take a step back and ask yourself what your objectives are. Obviously you want to make a nice return without too much risk but do you have any environmental or societal criteria?
There's 4 main ways to incorporate ESG into a portfolio;
Obviously there's a lot to cover here so we can take it one question at a time if you want.
Good explanation. Kudos.
I like the morningstar site, as it allows to filter a very wide universe of funds according to a broad set of criteria, including returns and management fees. Going green doesn’t mean wanting to get fleeced.
Does actually have the better S&P ESG score (65 vs 36 for Exxon and 46 for BP)
To muddy the waters, Exxon's MSCI rating is BBB while Shell's is AA so its not cut and dried.
People use the scores/ratings as a ""definitive"" company A is better than company B when the reality is that there's still a lot of subjectivity in the weightings of the various factors, and even the assessment of the scores for the factors themselves.
Edit: sorry, I misread your comment as Exxon having a better score than Shell.

Factors Employed to Determine the ESG Ratings,"When referencing the ESG rating, the MSCI ESG is often used. MSCI ESG regulation and ratings aim to estimate a company’s management of financially relevant ESG risks and opportunities. The rules-based methodology is employed to identify industry leaders and laggards as per their exposure to ESG risks and how to assess those risks relative to peers. The ESG Ratings range from - leader (AAA, AA), average (A, BBB, BB) to laggard (B, CCC).  
The MSCI ESG score is based on the categories that are broken down as follows: 

Learn more about ESG Rating from this article- The ESG Rating Phenomenon: A Guide to Understand ESG Ratings","The problem with these ratings is they do not assess if a company is doing good or anything related to furthering his goals. They just assess if any upcoming regulation will impact these companies
So, for example, an axe murderer could still do their thing, but the rating would just show if upcoming legal changes would affect this axe murderer, and possibly impact their business.
When you think about the service itself is pretty useless. Which is why most major active managers and institutional LPs don't use these ratings.
They do, but that isn't the primary purpose of these ratings. You are mixing up ESG with sustainability. Do you know the difference?
Who told you that? Lots of active managers use them.
Do you know of any active manager using ratings for decision making ?
Pretty much any fund with an ESG label (that isn't just greenwashing) will incorporate third-party ratings into their investment process. Eg here's what Fidelity say (https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/esg-ratings)
Is your disbelief because you've not come across any, or that you don't see value in them so you don't think others should either?
I was in capital markets for 20 years and was invovled in various ESG fund launches where the ratings were used mainly for reporting. I work at a firm that is focused on climate risk valuation and none of the clients of the firm use the ratings from big providers in their decision making, it seems focused on reporting only.
I've been in the markets for over 25 years on both the sellside and the buyside. I'm currently an active manager of article 9 funds and I incorporate ESG ratings in my investment process.
Using the ratings is not the same as relying on the ratings in the investment process. I would liken it to price targets from the sellside - I'm not going to just assume they are correct and adopt them as my own but they can help me to assess the overall tone before digging in the detail.
I mainly use MSCI, Sustainalytics and S&P (Trucost) for my external ESG inputs. If I see that a company I'm looking at has a poor rating, it will make me pretty negatively disposed towards investing in it. It doesn't mean that I definitely won't but I'd have to materially disagree with the reasoning behind the low score to then buy it (that has happened only once for me).
Thank you, this is super helpful.
What do the ratings do to help you? We work with some fairly larger investors/pension plans and wealth funds where we see the ratings being passed to them as a post-trade process. Do you review it like a new source on the names in your fund? or is there something else? Like the FT writes a article on a company you own but if your disagree you hold the postion.
As I mentioned earlier, they are akin to price targets in a research report. If a price target is very high or very low, it prompts me to investigate the reason why the analyst is so bullish/bearish.
They are also useful in the aggregate - how does your portfolio compare to the benchmark.
You're missing the point of ESG integration. It is quite simply risk management - no more, no less. Here's a simple example:
If a company has a single factory in a location prone to flooding, that's an environmental risk so you'd ask them what measures they take to protect themselves. If they have lots of measures that are proven to be effective then the risk is managed.
If they don't do anything then you have to factor that risk into your assessment. You could increase your discount rate, or you could forecast a 50% loss in sales every 16 years. You won't know whether your adjustment is correct until after the fact but at least you've done something, which is better than not doing anything.
Blending ESG down into a single score is useful for looking at the aggregates but there's always subjectivity involved at the individual stock level. Two companies may have the same score but the way that score is arrived at could differ a lot - one could have good E and S but lousy G, while the other has poor E but good S and G. That's just the nature of taking loads of inputs to spit out a singular answer.
It's not a case of agreeing or disagreeing. The article will flag something negative about the company that you probably didn't know about before and then you have to assess how much that changes your view/valuation. If you did know about it beforehand then you have implicitly accounted for that risk beforehand (doesn't mean you were right though).
Thank you so much for this.

I'd say that these ratings are attempting to quantify what is 'good'.
To build.on your analogy, what if Axe Murderer A worked as a heart surgeon 'saving lives' each day, planted trees on weekends, and made meaningful donations to conservation organizations? They also killed some folks throughout the year.
Meanwhile Axe Murderer B just killed people?
The intent of these ratings is to help quantify the overall performance of a company, and not just hang their entire performance on 1 factor like axe murdering.

MITRE approach for data sharing,"In the cyber defence world, we use MITRE as an approach to share information about bad actors and their tactics techniques and procedure (TTP). For example, you can see one bad actor here. https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator//#layerURL=https%3A%2F%2Fattack.mitre.org%2Fgroups%2FG0117%2FG0117-enterprise-layer.json
So I was thinking about whether the same approach be adopted. However, instead of looking at companies, we should be looking at governments' action/plans/results from local govt all the way to the federal level. I think this is an area that is not well known. Govts are very good at making policies but how well do by examples? Obviously, I apologize in advance should there be something in the works already. My work deals with government policies and in particular, how their thinking is translated to results.
To give you an example, most government policies are top-down and use money as a way to reach goals. In NSW Australia, one of the ways to reach zero by 2030 is to spend 400 Mio in getting rid of fossil vehicles to electric (ie for their employees' needs). They have not considered employees working remotely or whether another type of transportation is more efficient (think school bus and the fun we all had when we were young then and nobody was ever late either) or whether moving their offices closer to where their employees lived etc. Say moving can save $XXX and shorten 10 mins traveling time for each employee as a goal.
Another example is using ""green"" bond. Currently, the only qualification is to hire an external party to verify the funds are earmarked for a ""green"" project but there is nothing more than whether the ""green"" project is able to achieve its goals. Say its goal was to reduce X tonnes in 12 months but only manage half in the first year of operation. In my view, these specific goals should be included and reflected. In this case, bondholders are entitled to say higher rates for the extra climate risk ?
So I am thinking of a base model where these policies/practices can be recorded at the government level for all to see and of course to solicit ""improvements"" which are common-sense or could be non-conventional.
The reason why I am proposing this MITRE approach is that during WW2, the US Government did invite ideas from the public to beat Germany, which is the earliest crowd idea sourcing that I can see. One of those who answer was a person by the name of Albert Einstein. But the US Army/CIA was curious and happy to try his suggestion and the rest is history. The CIA was willing to try anything even psychics later known as ""mind readers"".
In the same way, we are facing our own WW3, we need workable ideas and the best way to start to is have a baseline today and assess what our governments are doing other than printing money.",,7 months ago,"['Wed, Sep 28, 2022, 05:37:40 AM Central European Summer Time']",

Thank you! This gives me a great starting point!
Mexico did a use of proceeds 'SDG bond' not an SLB - Sanofi I think is purely social because the KPI is access to medicine iirc. I see quite a lot of health and safety/time lost to incident metrics on SLBs so this might be something that worker voice ties into?

ESG investing vs. using other metrics,"For the past two years I have been working in the space of sustainable finance, impact investing and climate fintech and I wanted to share some thoughts on ESG investing and ask for people's opinions.
The Economist dedicated one of their July’s issues to debating the shortcomings of ESG investing. Multiple articles in this issue and online went over how ESG investing has become a fad since Elon Musk defined it a scam earlier this year. Inflated AUM numbers, The whole investment industry using ESGs to charge higher fees. ESG rating firms producing wildly inconsistent ratings. Analysts taking decisions on personal preferences rather than objective criteria. ESG funds underdelivering because divested from fossil fuels or arms producers. ESG investing just being a feel-good scheme for investors.
It’s clear to me that there is some truth in what is mentioned in these articles.
Many in the financial industry took advantage of the fad to charge higher fees, more often than not rating agencies all have different methodologies that yield completely different results and there isn’t always a correlation between ESG investing and results.
So is ESG investing not working or useless? It's not in his current form, but I believe sustainable finance it's here to stay.
People care about the future, and many understand that things like climate change, gender and pay inequalities and the inefficient use of resources are interwoven with a company’s long term performance. Both the European and US governments are working to standardise reporting, and quality of the data will be key in the improvement of sustainability and impact reporting.

It would be very interesting to hear how all of you integrate sustainability / ESG ratings / sustainability metrics in your investments or how you invest sustainably/impactfully. What's your strategy? Do you look at metrics and/or ESG ratings? Or do you use any other tools?","I agree. My team and I built a tool to help eliminate some of the greenwashing where we compare company metrics directly. Whilst we provide ESG scores from a data sources we directly compare company metrics. This gives our users better insight as to how companies perform against their peers.

Great Question! I was also interested in the same question but I was shocked to see how greenwashed many of these ESG portfolios were. This article really clears things up. I beleive they used sustainalytics' metrics when determining how environmentally friendly the funds actually were.

Career Advice,I am a communications major with a background in marketing. I want to know if it is possible to have a career in sustainable finance with a degree in communications?,"Yes.

Started in finance after 6 years of pure marketing experience (advertising, PR). Understanding maths (and/or financial products) help a lot. A LOT. Hit me up for further questions/details.
that’s amazing! i guess its never too late to try🤷‍♀️ If I have any questions I will definitely hit you up! Thank you so much for your answer☺️
Yes, look at roles at sustainable finance NGOs and industry groups/ alliances. There’s many roles and comms is essential.
Communicating the case for sustainable finance to clients, stakeholders, the public etc is a plausible (and meaningful) career path. E.g., check out links in this sub. At least some will point to content that has been written by somebody with your background.
It will require learning sustainability and finance essentials along the way. The more you can pick up the technical details the wider the potential jobs spectrum.
Caveat: Its a rapidly evolving field (see e.g rise and fall of ""ESG investing"" in just a few years), you will need to chart your own path. By all means ride the fashion waves but keep an eye on the real currents underneath
Best success
At least there’s hope even if its not easy. Thank you so much for answering! ☺️
^ yup. prob go with this path.
Honestly? Not what you’re providing here. Get a mathematics or CS minor if it’s not too late. If you’re good at excel and an organized/quantitative person, it’s definitely possible. But you need to get on that track. Stay away from BD and “policy” ppl (unless they can read a utility rate case).
If you’re really serious, I’d look for the finance jobs in Lev Fin (they’re desperate for ppl) and translate that into a sustainable finance job after two years.
If you get the good investing training, that’s what’s important.
I’m not entirely on board with you here re: policy people — though I might be biased because that’s my career path.
I’m not sure where you’re from, but not all countries’ policy career tracks are as backwards as the US. European policy analysts / researchers generally have to have a background in law or economics, if not both, and then need to do a LOT of training in the field they’re analysing. US policy tracks do, however, just seem like lobbyist factories.
Some careers (like policy) differ enormously between geographical regions. OP should provide more context.
If you can build a supply/demand model or analyze a rate case, you’re not a “policy” person. You’re an economist, a tariff specialist, etc. I use the term “policy ppl” to refer to those folks that do a lot of talking about renewables, new laws, climate accords but are doing it for marketing/BD purposes. They usually spent time in Washington DC and host lots of webinars…
Thank you for the suggestion, I will try it and thank you for answering! ☺️
It will probably be hard at first, but yes. I know people with history degrees that work in finance. The math isn't hard (if you can add, subtract, divide, multiply, and use exponents, you're fine). Try working for a startup, take some courses online, or in a non-finance role at the kind of company you want and try to move departments after a while.
If you show interest and some talent, you can get a shot.
Also, learn Excel and PowerPoint. Like, elite level, ninja skills.
I see, I will try to take more online courses and practice☺️ Thank you for your answer!",9 months ago,[],Careers

"Love coffee, hate non-recyclable cups","The production and disposal of single use items like disposable cups bring several negative impacts on the environment, such as global warming and pollution. Here are five reasons why these cups are so problematic:
In addition, paper, plastic and styrofoam cups cause the depletion of resources and add to the global landfill crisis.
How could that possibly be changed? By making paper cups recyclable, which means big companies like Starbucks changing the plastic coated cups to eco-friendly alternatives.
Any thoughts on that?","This is an important discussion but maybe more appropriate for r/sustainability. Discussing concrete technological or behavioral solutions is fine provided the economic or financial aspect plays a material role. Otherwise we drift into specialized areas that sub members might have neither expertise nor interest
Strong disagree with the solution you came up with, coming up with fully recyclable cups should be the last resort in solving this problem. The mantra goes ‘reduce, reuse, recycle’, in that particular order.
As a fellow coffee lover, we’ll throw out ‘reduce’ as reducing coffee consumption in order to save on coffee cup consumption is not really a viable strategy. Which leaves ‘reuse’, which should be the default solution- reusable takeaway cups (whether glass, metal or plastic) should be the norm; there should be a discount for bringing a reusable cup for a coffee order, or alternatively an extra charge for using a single use cup, in order to encourage the use of reusable coffee mugs.

I want to share this incredible story with you, as it may inspire some of you to do the same.
I study a Master's programme at the University of Amsterdam (UvA) and I was also part of the uni's Green Office. Through my master's I got into the sustainability/sustainable finance rabbit hole. I got to know about how much investments still flow to fossil fuels. I found out that my university has an account at Deutsche Bank which administers 90% of the budget of the UvA. The budget accounts for around 760mil EUR/year.
Together with the Central Student Council of the UvA, we walked a long journey since January and drafted 'unsolicited advice' to the Executive Board of the UvA to make an independent tendering procedure to find a bank that does invest in fossil fuels, and does not invest in the military or does not breach human rights. This week, we got an official confirmation that our proposal was accepted and a timeline was drafted.

"Slow 2050 net-zero scenarios not worth the paper they're written on, say economists",,"Oh so kind of you!
Link throws error for me - could it be a location issue? I am in Ireland.
I just checked again and seems to work (from NL). Maybe was temporary?
Still 403 forbidden - weird!
Its actually a republication of this: https://www.breakthroughonline.org.au/commentary and the actual paper is here: https://www.nber.org/papers/w28472
Stay up to date with leading analysts from our major contributors. Model-based net-zero scenarios, including those of the IPCC, aren’t worth the paper they are written on, say leading economists
World-leading economists have blown a hole right through the middle of the main tool used to produce the net-zero scenarios embraced by climate policymakers.
In a new paper, Sir Nicholas Stern, Nobel Laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz and Charlotte Taylor conclude that climate-energy-economy Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), which are the key tool in producing net-zero scenarios, “have very limited value in answering the two critical questions” of the speed and nature of emissions reductions and “fail to provide much in the way of useful guidance, either for the intensity of action, or for the policies that deliver the desired outcomes”. The research paper is The economics of immense risk, urgent action and radical change: towards new approaches to the economics of climate change.
Now this is a big thing, because IAMs are at the centre of the IPCC Working Group III report on mitigation, and “have played a major role in IPCC reports on policy, which, in turn, have played a prominent role in public discussion. They continue to play a very powerful role in the research activities of economists working on climate change.”
And it is not just the IPCC. The net-zero plans which are the focus of international discussion — such as those of the International Energy Agency and the world’s bankers (Network for Greening the Financial System) — are completely dependent on IAMs.
Last year Breakthrough’s report, Degrees of Risk, described how an objectivity is bestowed on IAMs that they do not serve: they are highly subjective tools with unrealistic assumptions that more than anything else reflect modellers’ view of society. Depending on how modellers perceive the roots of the problem to be solved, they will “design the model structure, including possible instruments and relationships within the model accordingly... Hence, the very structure of a model depends on the modeller’s beliefs about the functioning of society”. Consequently, IAM results have the capacity to privilege particular pathways and entice policymakers into thinking that the forecasts the models generate have some kind of scientific legitimacy.
A stunning example is the set of net-zero 2050 (NZ2050) scenarios being promoted by the world’s central bankers. They have up to 50% of primary energy use coming from fossil fuels in 2050, “offset” by use of unreliable carbon accounting and land-based measures — including bio-energy — which impinge upon and may decrease land for cropping even as demand for food increases by half over the next 30 years This agenda is supported by the fossil fuel industry and by some “climate activist” investor groups.
The economists' research identifies a number of fundamental problems with IAMs, some of which are intrinsic to their structure and cannot be remedied. Perhaps the biggest is the deep uncertainty that surrounds climate change, let alone the uncertainty in trying to map those physical changes into social and economic impacts. Deep uncertainty exists “where the outcomes cannot be fully described” and hence cannot be quantified. Yet without quantification of future costs and benefits, IAMs simply cannot compute: they break down and can provide no answer.
An allied problem is the failure of IAMs to deal with extreme risk (such as “fat tails”, where there is a higher probability of occurrences at the high end of the range of possibilities). As the authors note, “the world has been much more focused than the IAMs on a different set of issues, the risks of catastrophic consequences”. They say:
“When we combine the uncertainties—about climate science, about the “right” economic model, about the parameters of the models, about the changes in those parameters over time, about the political processes which affect both the environment and economy— climate policymaking is a quintessential example of decision making under uncertainty, where the decisions themselves affect the magnitude of the uncertainties.
“The standard IAMs pay only limited attention to risk and ignore uncertainty. While in some cases the former can, with some difficulty, be incorporated into the analysis, the latter cannot...
“Deep uncertainty—where individuals do not know all of the possible outcomes and the probabilities of occurrence of different possible events, and know that they don’t know— presents even more fundamental methodological difficulties for the IAM. In particular, it gives rise to incomplete orderings. This is inconsistent with the underlying (but rarely stated) hypothesis in the IAMs that there is a complete ordering. And, it is not just the incompleteness per se of the ordering that is the problem; it is where the incompleteness arises, which is the inability to describe and evaluate some of the most important, catastrophic outcomes.
“In short, in the presence of deep uncertainty, the framework of maximising expected utility lacks credible foundations, and under plausible assumptions, rational individuals undertake more precautionary behaviour than might be suggested by such a model.”
This is but one of a number of fundamental flaws identified by Stern, Stiglitz and Taylor. Others include:
As noted in Degrees of Risk, The NGFS scenarios chronically underestimate future damage, using IAMs that basically ignore non-linearities and cascades. The NGFS admits its damage estimate from physical risks “only cover a limited number of risk transmission channels. For example, they do not capture the risks from sea-level rise or severe weather. They also assume socio-economic factors such as population, migration and conflict remain constant even at high levels of warming.” This, in itself, is enough to disqualify these scenarios from being seen as credible stories about alternative futures.
Can more realistic damage functions improve IAMs? Studies with more realistic damages bring can IAMs into line with Paris goals, but while they might make the IAMs seem more reasonable, these studies simply illustrate, but do not resolve, the extreme sensitivity of results in these models, which make them very weak frameworks for policymaking: “the problems of foundational weaknesses associated with extreme risk, deep uncertainty and the challenges of structural change are still not resolved” say Stern, Stiglitz and Taylor.
And rather than reply on carbon prices, a diversity of policies is required:
“The IAMs have been particularly influential in the calculation of carbon prices for use in appraisal of public programmes. They have been used to suggest relatively low levels for carbon taxes… Given the severe limitations of the IAMs, and the multitude of key issues that arise in fostering a green transition, it makes sense to adopt a diversity of approaches to analysis and modelling to understand and illuminate these issues and relevant policy responses.
Stern, Stiglitz and Taylor conclude that even “new and improved” IAMs are likely to be of only limited value in providing policy guidance. Even if the assumptions are made more realistic, these models “have been shown to be very unrobust; they are not helpful for guiding policy decisions, unless we are very confident in all of the key functions and their parameters—which we cannot be”.
And an alternative? Rather than IAMs which are based on cost-benefit analysis in a world where the costs (damages) simply cannot be quantified, it is suggested that a better approach is to set a reasonable, consensus goal, and then find the best way of achieving that goal:
The difference is analogous to that between cost-benefit and cost- effectiveness analysis. In many arenas of policy where the benefits are hard to evaluate— wars, regulations which affect health, safety and life itself or biodiversity—there is often resort to cost-effectiveness analysis. An agreement is first reached on goals and constraints, and economic analysis centres on the best way to achieve the given goals within the constraints.",11 months ago,[],General Resource

Is ESG at the end of the day a more sophisticated greenwashing?,"Today I was having a meeting with some of my friend that work in esg for some of the big player investment firms and one in a on of the big 4 consultants in Zürich.

Anyways they are good with it since it’s a major trend and pay well. Do you guys see like that as well?","
However, due to some specific market actions, combined with a lack of scientific (biology, ecology, Geography etc.) expertise among the people managing ESG systems, the whole enterprise has become (sans regulations) rather non-robust.
One of the biggest mistakes made by almost all ESG systems is aggregated scoring. This is a mathematics move which allows crappy scores in one ESG area to effectively be indemnified by good scores in another. This makes zero climate or ecological sense, but is easy for non-scientists (accountants and traders) to understand.
In addition, the use of sector based normalisation (looking at you, MSCI) was a terrible idea. This allowed for operators in incredibly harmful sectors to artificially disguise their impact due to being ranked only against their sector peers, and not against actors across the entire economy.
I put some of the failures down to the fact that many financial institutions stocked their ESG teams not with natural sciences expertise, but with extant finance industry insiders.
ESG is just a catch all for trying to monitor and eventually shift behaviour in capital allocation. It's not a scam per se, it's just in its infancy and therefore open to abuse. Over time it will become better defined, better regulated (certainly in Europe at least) more useful and less abused. But even traditional financial disclosures are open to interpretation and spin so you won't get rid of bad actors spinning the data to fit their own narrative. The trick as ever will be in the skill of those whose job it is to interpret the data, and draw their own conclusions.
The bigger question tho is whether ESG considerations are enough (even good ones) or if there is a more fundamental problem with the nature of modern financial markets and this current version of Capitalism.
What is sure is that the underlying need for ""ESG"" or sustainable finance is a major and long term trend that will see many turns of the road. There will be lots of bubbles / crashes. Not because there is something wrong with financing a transition to a sustainable economy (a noble cause if there ever was one). But the existing financial system has major flaws that make the road more bumpy than needed.
a) its overfinancialized: too many people (intermediaries), trading too much, on too many derivative or speculative instruments. If dogecoin became a thing then anything with an ounce of reality (and ESG claims plenty of that) is subject to become a bubble. Particularly in periods of ""easy money"" the system goes berserk with people chasing deals, needing to put ""money to work"" and justify the size of the sector
b) its unhinged, disconnected from reality: from economic theory itself that lives in some la-la land, to the missing machinery of collecting hard data (because that looks like dirty work, poor ROI), to investor behavior that is addicted to looking at Brownian motion graphs to detect patterns rather than toil with ""fundamentals"" - its all a phony parallel universe, entirely defined in narrow monetary terms
Addressing these flaws is, in my opinion the true road to sustainable sustainable finance (and in a good scenario will keep us busy :-)
ESG is just a way of defining loosely agreed, non financial indicators used in assessment of companies/ assets by financial firms. As these are loosely agreed and lightly (though increasingly) regulated, ‘greenwashing’ is intentionally or unintentionally fudging those indicators, if consultants believe and are enabling that, then they are a huge part of the problem.
Imo, only once ESG reporting standards and disclosure requirements become mandated for public companies will ESG data become meaningful. At the moment, it’s hard to place any reliance on a company’s ESG reporting until there are universally adopted standards and third party audits. So not greenwashing, but not super meaningful in comparing one investment to another.. yet.",u/[deleted],[],Discussion / Question

It's called ""Beyond Net Zero: How to Mobilize Passive Investing Towards Paris Alignment with a Focus on the United States."" It points at a couple big current themes...
What we did: Constructed criteria for aligning with the Paris Agreement, then compared these with 35 leading ESG passive funds.
What we found: None were fully aligned. Resilience and just transition factors are often left out of fund management. Even on mitigation too many funds use less-robust indicators like emissions intensity and fail to consider deforestation or lobby activity in portfolio construction.
We close with recommendations for regulators, data and index providers, and asset managers -- maybe some of you fit into those classes! -- and with the hope that someone will soon offer a product that will be fully aligned :D

Thanks for sharing. Have added to my reading list to study in detail.
One thing I would add and a slightly positive spin is that we are actually seeing an increasing number of funds focusing on solutions and outcomes rather than just reducing emissions, and an increasing availability of data on issues like deforestation that you mention.

Growing Pressure on Corporate boards and Government authorities to Enhance their ESG Skills...,"In 2022, due to the rising demands for action, corporate representatives and government authorities will likely pressure for more accountability to exhibit that they are adequately equipped to oversee ESG issues. This broadening of the scope of corporate board responsibilities will also require more focus and time commitment to meet their duties. The mounting pressure on board members to streamline their ESG credentials is set to grow as investors are demanding better accountability and a heightened focus on sustainability.  
Government and corporate leaders are feeling the pressure to strengthen their ESG skills and integrate sustainability policy planning. The activism of shareholders and stakeholders will increase in this area in 2021. And this trend is set to gain momentum in 2022.

Is ESG a bubble ? (Referring As per article in Bloomberg) should one make a career in ESG ? Or its waste of efforts?,,"To the extent regulators require disclosure, and that seems likely, companies will comply and there will be work at those companies. As long as money management world can charge more if it’s ESG that world will have jobs. Job growth in other areas is unknown, perhaps unlikely.
for every corporate entity that reports there will be at least one banking relationship manager that needs to be clued up on ""ESG"". which in a scenario where things are taken seriously means a diverse set of team specializations: energy / emissions, supply chain material pathways, labor conditions, protected areas, you name it.
away from the corporate realm, there is a tsunami of sovereign, municipal and other ""green finance"" issuance. all of them notes must be structured, ""rated"", traded etc.
finally there are latent markets in environmental ""macro"" variables (in the image of carbon trading) to which some of the said instruments may make reference.
So I would speculate there will be actually quite a few finance jobs that carry the spirit but not the name of ""ESG"". The way I think of this is making up for the backlog of unreported externalities. It has to be done, it will be done one way or another and the machinery / bureaucracy around it will be a decent chunk of finance.
Is there a certification and a shortcut way to those jobs? Nope.
More and more board rooms are talking about ESG (latest figure was 20% I think based on earnings call transcripts). It’s mentioned in an increasing number of annual reports and it’s becoming the standard for large companies to publish annual ESG reports of their own (whilst taking into consideration double materiality). ESG assets are set to hit 50 trillion by 2025 and supervision/regulation is evolving with this trend (SEC climate risk, TCFD, EU SFDR/CSRD, ISSB and some initiatives in APAC).
It’s not without its faults though (e.g. greenwashing, shitty fragmented data, nobody knows what the ‘S’ really means in ESG). I think it’s here to stay in one form or another - it’s the start of a seismic shift from shareholder to stakeholder capitalism that only accelerates with the boomers retiring. Certainly not a bubble as it’s been around far too long through economic/credit cycles to fit that definition.
Any serious knowledge you build around sustainability and how the financial system supports or hinders the transition will only grow in importance.
The current ""ESG"" backlash is quite real, but its because people have abused widespread anxiety for a quick buck. So that ship has sailed, you're unlikely to retire before 30 pushing ""ESG"" stocks.
But if by career you mean a full professional trajectory that will span a few decades and where you will build deep expertise on some aspect of sustainability, then you are in good shape. All sustainability issues whether environmental or social are real, people are not making them up to keep busy, they are not going away, they will only get worse if left unmanaged.
And its not all about managing gloom and decline. There will be some positive upsides now and then: new technologies, new digital tools that will make this task easier and more exciting. Just stay away from hysterical hypes.
People who can really help finance the transition will be needed. But think of sustainable finance more like an engineering role: the facts do matter. So if ""glitter"" is your thing maybe better jump into NFT's, influencers, the metaverse or something like that ;-)
Interesting question, but I don't think the term 'bubble' can be applied to a field like ESG. It's not like it is crypto or tech or a particular market. ESG is a practise that can be applied across all industries.
A better question might be; will ESG lose traction. Or, will there be fewer jobs in ESG. Will governments, corporations, small businesses and individuals, focus less on long-term, multi-generation prosperity and instead revert back to a shot-sighted agenda?
I definitely don't think it's a waste of effort.
So in a way ESG may loose its glitter ?
Similar to other commenters, no I don't think ESG will lose traction. In my opinion, if society and the economy let sustainable practise fall by the wayside, then we will head towards a civilisation collapse scenario.
So, while there are lots of problems with the execution of ESG, I really hope that it improves and doesn't ""lose its glitter""",11 months ago,"['Tue, Jun 07, 2022, 04:07:23 PM Central European Summer Time']",Careers

“In today’s globally interconnected world, a company must create value for and be valued by its full range of stakeholders in order to deliver long-term value for its shareholders. It is through effective stakeholder capitalism that capital is efficiently allocated, companies achieve durable profitability, and value is created and sustained over the long-term. Make no mistake, the fair pursuit of profit is still what animates markets; and long-term profitability is the measure by which markets will ultimately determine your company’s success. At the foundation of capitalism is the process of constant reinvention – how companies must continually evolve as the world around them changes or risk being replaced by new competitors.”

Aggregate ESG confusion: The Divergence of ESG Rating,,"I noticed this got little/no appreciation; this was a great paper and hit me at a perfect time. Thanks for putting it on the radar
It is indeed a great (and timely) piece of research. I had intuitively assumed that subjective factors in constructing ESG ratings (what they term scope / weight) would be the primary driver of diveregence. Was intrigued to see that actually it is the (pressumably more objective) measurement differences are the most dominant factor.

ESG isn’t a scam. Here’s why.,,"How did Tesla get kicked out of the ESG index?
And where does nuclear power stand in ESG?
Here's a fun video about Tesla's ESG score and why they got kicked from the index:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AqipTHmYoA
Nuclear power is less about ESG and more about negative screening (or divestment). Most ""responsible"" funds exclude nuclear power and uranium mining entirely, so the ESG scores of those companies don't matter.
Why are ESG funds divesting from nuclear energy? Isn't Germany a case study of why you shouldn't divest from nuclear power?
I think it's mostly a throwback to 1990's environmentalists and their hate for nuclear (gets lumped in with gambling, tobacco, weapons etc). It's a controversial topic in the industry, but IMO it's kind of overblown. In reality, there are very few publicly traded nuclear companies (most are private or gov't owned) so it doesn't have much of an impact on the portfolio.
They don't treat employees very well. E is for the environment, but S (Social) and G (Governance) also has to be taken into account
Ya, it's mostly that Tesla's investor relations team didn't both filling out S&P's survey =/ kinda lazy if you ask me...
ESG is not a bad thing. Its necessary for all environment including human bring.
The main thing is the SDGs proposed by UNO is very vast thing. UN have wear multiple hats of SDGs and and there is a confusion for these 17 goals and 169 targets and 232 unique Indicators.
In 2015 UN, adopted agenda of 17 Sustainable Development goals. If you look at this, these goals are related to each other. Like, if there is Quality Education, then one can get good job. With good education, one can think of Good Health and Well-being of individual and of society also. Having Decent Work and Economic Growth, there will be Zero Hunger and No Poverty in the society. Caring for Climate Action leads to Clean Water and Sanitation, Responsible Consumption and Production, Sustainable Life Below Water and Life on Land. Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure is the path for Economic Growth. If a community has Clean Water and Sanitation facilities, then there will be a Good Health and think of Well-being of a society. If society progresses in Quality Education then there will be Reduced Inequality with Gender Equality. Sustainable Cities and Communities create more jobs and lesser dependencies of fossil fuel can be judged having Affordable and Clean Energy of renewable energy sources like solar and wind energy. With Peace and Justice Strong Institutions, there will be significant reduction of all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere. Partnerships to achieve the Goal Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development.
As more and more nations and organisations are heading to achieve SDGs goals and publishing the figures to achieve some of the goals also, it is an illusion. We are heading wrong direction, or else we are not approaching towards goals with the speed it require.
There is no proper target publishing method or what we say as framework available. We certainly do not have foundation to work on these goals. Organisations are showing progress in showing pictures, photos in their ESG reports. Previously also organisations are working on this through CSR method.
What needs to be done is cut down these 17 SD Goals, 169 SDG Targets and 232 indicators to minimum one say only 5, because these goals are related to each other. Good education, good job, good economics then good food, good lifestyle, no poverty.
We had the MDGs before the SDGs. They were much fewer. The criticism was that they were too few and sustainable development needs more nuance hence the SDGs.
Whether large or small, achieving thing is different aspects. You think that there are 232 unique Indicators. This is huge number.
Take an example of one such indicator in Goal No. 14:-
""14.3.1 Average marine acidity (pH) measured at agreed suite of representative sampling stations""
It is quite impossible in developing nation, in villages to check, monitor, maintain and report pH levels at certain frequency of time. What they need is a pure, potable water in first phase. Later on they can achieve pH and other things.
What UN and corporate and NGO needs is to address priority goals and then look after indicators.
Please note: These ESG, SDGs things are required and someone has to take a lead on it. UN has already taken, now we have to.
The whole point of the SDGs is that countries (developing or not) develop their own development plans with their own set of priorities within that but within the comprehensive SDG framework. So what you ask for is the core idea of the SDGs. And I fully agree: not everyone should try to do everything at once.
It would be good to have at least one area of real progress. This would be a huge gain as it could be a blueprint for how to solve more of these thorny challenges that until now we either ignored or assumed unsolvable.
Some people argue there is too much focus on just one dimension (climate change and GHG reduction). But lots of talking is not the same as lots of results. In fact 2021 saw the highest emissions ever and the current crisis will further set things back as people reingnite coal plants...
IMO, as the SDG is tied with ESG and ESG is tied with investments, there is a race between corporates to chase for money and investors. The SDGs are directly taken by industries as a point of achieving monetary thing and they are thinking it as something marketing tool. They are not doing it for any good reason. ESG is now a big set of CSR. Although, there is a caveat of declaration of results in ESG reporting, companies treat it to paint it in Greenwash.
Thank you and fully agree on the point of set own priorities.
does a good job clarifying that there are two very different types of ESG critics, with very different motivations and objectives: those who despise everything it stands for and those who don't think it does enough. But in any case, ESG is under the spotlight nowadays and arguably that is a better place than being ignored :-)
I disagree: this article is mixing politics into the ESG discussion. It starts in the opening by claiming that Elon Musks criticism is politically motivated. That’s silly. Tesla was kicked from that particular ESG index for lacking a “low carbon strategy”. That’s a ridiculous assertion by S&P - especially if they allow oil companies new into the index. This kind of problem needs to be addressed - let’s be honest: today “ESG” is the equivalent to “includes all natural ingredients” - we need an agreement on what constitutes an acceptable minimum standard for ESG. In my view at the very bare minimum no company that violates the Paris agreement should be calling itself sustainable.
I think we are creating serious and unnecessary friction by bundling so many concepts together under ""ESG"". I guess the motivation was to ""keep it simple"" but maybe it is oversimplifying. E.g., An entity can be carbon-neutral but a biodiversity disaster (if the way they source their renewable energy invades critical habitats). Or be it can be an environmental darling and be a horrible workplace. Etc. etc. Metrics and risks that are different should be monitored, reported, rated, managed etc differently.
Sustainability is complex issue. The UN Sustainable Development Goals are 17 distinct categories and they all address serious issues. Creating one dimensional simplifications is good for creating bandwagons but not necessarily long-term sustainable as a framework for investors and other stakeholders. The price of a backlash against current practices will be confusion, procrastination and further damage.
I agree with you here. My point is about minimum standards and standards: USDA Organic certified food may not be the best of the best - but it is a somewhat credible minimum standard and leaps and bounds better than “natural, sustainable food” as a label. The problem we face in investments is that “ESG” is a great idea but - for the lack of credible standards - ultimately meaningless as a label.
yes, its a major and urgent issue. I like the analogy with credit ratings. Credit ratings had one century of development (Moody's first rating circa 1909) and yet that did not prevent the 2008 crisis (where methodologies and standards were systematically abused).
Opinions as to how much time we have for the sustainability transition vary, but for sure we don't have a century...

HSBC suspends banker after he accuses central bankers and policymakers of overstating the financial risks of climate change. The presentation / remarks behind the controversy available on the Financial Times YouTube channel. FT Reporting in link,,"A basic problem here is he seems to have the risk assessment wrong.
Like ""I'm jumping through traffic. I haven't been hit yet, therefore jumping through traffic is safe.""
What is really dumb about this is that his presentation was cleared by the bank before he gave it. So basically he's just a scapegoat for saying something that the environmental zealots disagree with.
He’s high enough up he probably didn’t need clearance. This COMPLETELY flies in the face of HSBC’s strategic goals. Dumb ass just got himself canned.
Being suspended for this is preposterous. He outlines a completely reasonable argument and provides evidence for things that don’t align with his opponent’s arguments and things that I have honestly been curious about for ages.
If ESG side is so frail it cannot take one person with a counter narrative that they try and cancel them then that’s a big strike against credibility
Talk about denial... I guess that the changes brought by green/sustainable banks are even better and more needed than I thought. Anyone has positive experience with one of the names here?
Imho he makes an argument about loan book maturity that casts doubt on his technical competency to comment on financial risks (especially when they they manifest as systemic risks).
The revealing comment is: ""the average loan length is around six. So at year seven, what happens to the planet in year seven is actually irrelevant to our loan book.""
Unless these loans are amortizing to zero over six years (and almost no loan does this), somebody must refinance the loan at reasonable rates at year six or otherwise the borrower will go bust...
But that was in the context of his point about EPS multiples showing how far forward looking the market is. That even public markets for tech are forward looking to about 20. And he qualifies it at the end by pointing out its “from a financial risk perspective.” His point is to take down other allocators who were speaking before him saying that from a financial risk perspective relocation must happen now or returns will be impacted. And this seems to be a strong counter argument no?
This man and the evil bank he works for are idiots

Elon Musk called ESG a scam — did the Tesla chief do investors a favor?,,"It is a scam.it's funny that the company that has done more for green energy than anyone else is suddenly being dismissed for not bowing to politics.
Not a scam when you do not have tunnel vision. Musk does not like it because fixable business issues have cost him money and fixing the issues will cost him money. You do not get to be as rich as Musk without taking the money from somewhere. The purpose of social investing is to call out bad behavior. He just does not like to be called out.
I would not call it a scam but the Musk/Tesla case underscores a serious problem to the ""bundled"" ESG approach. Different people / investors assign vastly different weights to the different ""pillars"" of ESG.
As Albert Einstein said “Everything should be as simple as it can be, but not simpler”. Putting environmental, social etc all together ""keeps things simple"" but creates a lot of tension that is not really necessary.
In a sense this ESG bundling dilutes and diminishes the good work that goes into assessing externalities generated by companies
I have a massive issue with much ESG finance exactly since it emboldens criticism of all sustainable financing approaches.
I find the S&P accusation that Tesla has no credible “low carbon strategy” laughable.
But even if you ignore that specific ridiculous assertion- their ESG rating system is akin to my friend smoking “organic tobacco” for health reasons: you can pollute as much as you like - just don’t be the worst of the pack and voila - congrats you can call yourself sustainable.

The aim is in building a sustainable investment portfolio OR in choosing which companies to interact with on a daily basis. The idea is that the average person is becoming more and more ethically aware - so this could be a tool which is useful to them.
Thanks for responding and I can see how it might be a great tool (perhaps I phrased my question wrong) but what I meant to ask is how exactly do we use this tool?

It's not enough to offset with carbon credits as today's emissions wreak tomorrow's havoc.

Is there any real benefit of ESG reporting to the society?,I consider myself as someone who care about the environment and the communities. I accidentally took a ESG reporting course this semester. I hate it. I think the reporting is just yet another green washing tactic and I am so sick of it. I feel like I'm wasting my time whenever I do the coursework. The problem is my grades are at stake so I need to change my mind. Any suggestions?,"I think of it as a first step towards the right direction, even though it might be flawed and used for greenwashing. To point out, esg reporting is a risk assessment method that analyzes how ESG factors could impact a company. Which is not a problem from my POV. If at some point ESG reporting is transparent and the right incentives exist, I believe investors would move their money to the right place.
Tldr: transparent reporting + incentives + personal accountability = positive change
ESG is just a risk assessment tool. It adds to the risk evaluation process of investing. For real change we need to focus on impact investing. Helping so society leave bad practices impact investing has been around since humans. For example not investing in the slave trade, alcohol or sex trafficking are all examples of impact investing in the past. New and innovative products are coming out that allow everyday people to impact invest in social and environmental issues they care about. Checkout goparityca on Instagram for more info
Think of ESG as an early and deeply flawed sketch of what sustainable finance must eventually look like. Every weakness you identify is an opportunity to think and hopefully identify better, less compromised, less vague, less vacuous principles, frameworks and tools.
I think you’re ok to see ESG reporting as more of a chance for greenwashing. As another poster mentioned, without regulation it is essentially marketing material. However, in the EU currently non-financial disclosures are a required piece of a companies annual report (since 2017) and this year, new legislation is imposing stricter requirements on what type of information needs to be disclosed, and what types of activities can be considered green. In the US the SEC released a new proposal in March that would require the disclosure of green house gas emissions and the companies exposure risk too climate change related costs (either physical costs, from things like weather disruptions, or transitory costs, from things like converting their business off of fossil fuels). And, the SEC will require that those disclosures be assured by the auditing firm. So, I think in the past ESG reporting was subject to a lot of greenwashing, but I think I’m the future that will reduce substantially. It will certainly be very interesting to see the first fines levied for any annual report miss-statements. And I also think, that just from a social consciousness perspective, the more companies that are even thinking about ESG the better. If market forces are real, and resources are scarce, then the quality of ESG reporting would have to naturally improve in order to attract those customers and investors away from competition. Hopefully that gives you some energy to finish out your course with extra buy-in. Good luck!
Will you invest in the company who is unethical, have adverse impact on the Environment, adverse effect on you believe, and treats employees like slave
Most companies more or less have some unethical practices. It’s just the extent of them. It depends on the nature of the industries as well. Some ratings automatically lowers the score of oil companies as the production and the use of oil are not sustainable in nature. While companies that manufacture products are more likely to get involved in issues with labour and source materials.
The problem is that the companies rarely actively report such problems, or try to undermine their severity. I’m working on a case about IKEA and there’s not a single word about its illegal wood logging in their reports.
I don’t think this will change until the regulations become mature. And even then, I’m sure companies will exploit whatever loopholes they can find. It would be more reliable to use ratings and news as a reference.
Edit: delete repeated part.
As long as there's no compulsary reporting from regulator (like financial report), it's basically marketing for the company. The guideline (GRI, CCG, etc) is there to ensure company still report the things that mattered.
In some countries, the government/market requires company to report important things like a verified greenhouse gas emission, which I fully support for transparency reason.",1 year ago,"['Mon, Apr 25, 2022, 07:05:28 AM Central European Summer Time']",Discussion / Question

Here's the link for those interested: https://justcapital.com/news/pepsico-head-of-comms-and-former-best-buy-ceo-on-how-ukraine-war-is-testing-corporate-values/
So I've done some research and thinking, and I've come to the conclusion that boycotting/divesting stocks (for whatever reason: ties w/ Russia, fossil fools, etc). Basically what determines stock values is company performance and outlook based on balance sheets and such. If a group of investors, even a very large group, decides to boycott/divest from a stock, that could lead to the stock price temporarily decreasing. But that decrease in stock price just increases the opportunity for other (less scrupulous) investors to profit off that stock since it is lowering than what the financial statements say it should be. So essentially a boycott incentivizes other investors to buy that stock. On the other hand, if you do hold stock in that company, then you donate your profit to mitigate the problem. And, doesn't technically holding stock in a company give you sway over that company (obviously would need to hold a lot of stock)?
I wasn't an econ major or anything, so I'm generally curious about this and would love educated insight onto this topic.
u/nstutzman28 I agree with the thoughts you lay out above. The theme of divestment, while being well intentioned, removes the opportunity to engage with companies.

Best regards","What would be your expectations from it on the sustainability front? I.e. what do you understand/want to see as sustainable?
Hi as sustainable I understand really sustainability like solar modules manufacturers or off shore wind park sellers. At the end I would like a really strong green fund/etf.

For an all cap ETF, the root of the issue will be to find data that would have the coverage for the small cap end of the all cap.
In my allocation, I have looked for active open-ended/mutual funds that are invested across capitalisation. My fund provider has information on that but if yours does not, you can Google the funds available and see if you can find a Morningstar link for it - that will also have this info. Note that these funds will have higher fees though.
Hi thanks. Yes I've already got a broker for funds and I'm having the luck that I dont have to pay the exit fee - Me lucky little bastard cut of a deal ;)
I know found the Fund with the ISIN ""IE00BKLH2363""
Any opinions on this. I really like the small part of chinese assets, because my pf has like 7/8% chinese.
This is a pure play energy fund so if you are looking for broad exposure to sustainability this is going to miss most marks but maybe one or two themes. It will also introduce you to a lot of concentration risk to the energy sector, i.e. harsh swings upwards or downwards.
A good thing to do is to find the factsheets, annual reports, and/or presentations of these funds. These will give a clearer idea of what themes are reflected in the fund. I also suspect that the fund you linked may be a converted traditional energy fund judging by the inception date.
If you want to avoid Chinese exposure, then you can look for Europe/ex China/Americas funds as well. Feel free to DM me if you have any other funds in your mind - can't advise but happy to share thoughts/opinions.

"Is ESG fuzzy, imprecise and more marketing rhetoric?",,"I don't think it is, I think it's the beginning of a rather profound transformation. It is therefor quite natural to have such issues, and I believe they will get resolved as the standards mature.
I think there is one core issue with ESG - ‘metrics’. I work in a bank and we do plenty of ESG work and also use an ESG index to provide an ESG rating for assets, which works similarly to credit ratings. This enables us to understand which products better fit ESG goals from an investor standpoint. The problem is, the index we use is one of many and they don’t have uniform criteria which applies across each ESG index like, for example, GAAP accounting. This makes comparisons hard and greenwashing common.
It can and will improve, but unfortunately until there are better incentives for companies to do ESG than simply consumer pressure - e.g. tax breaks - which could be achieved by taxing less eco friendly products more/ lending at reduced interest rates etc. It is unlikely to improve the situation. If you’re interested, I wrote an article on Green Lending in the UK recently, which covers this in part and also gives an insight into how loans can be adjusted for this.
I’d be interested in reading the article you wrote
Sure, please take a look here: https://www.seed-bomb.com/blog - a few others that may be of interest too! Let me know if you have any questions
You're touching on taxonomy aligned investing. Have you ever considered brown penalising factors? Instead of incentiivisng, we can make borrowing more expensive for companies with bad esg rating - much more impactful
Not sure if this could be achieved for borrowing via corporate loans but funding in capital markets for green bonds is issued at concession to non green. Most of which is due to lack of supply of green products than incentivizing green efforts. I guess in theory this sounds good, but difficult to implement in reality.
The great Buckminster Fuller quote applies well here: ""In order to change an existing paradigm (in our case: fuzzy ESG) you do not try and change the problematic model - You create a new model and make the old one obsolete""
ESG is more like a taxonomy of sustainability problems that enjoy a loose consensus recognition rather than an incisive, sharp toolkit (laws, contracts, accounts, markets, incentives, penalties etc.) that will guide economic actors towards a sustainable economy.

Has anyone here taken the SASB FSA Credential exams?,"Just wondering if anyone here has taken this exam and has any tips on the following:
Did you use a prep provider?
Was the exam anything like the textbook or the mocks? Did you find it difficult?
Any other tips would be greatly appreciated!!","Any tips and the number required hours needed to prepare for FSA level 2 exam ? I have 10 days to take the exam and left with the last two chaps . Any tips would be appreciated
How did it go?
I was looking for doing this certification, would you recommend it?
I just took the FSA Level 1 exam and passed. For reference I got around a 68% on my first try at the sample questions before studying some more. When I reached out to SASB to try to find the passing grade, they said ""Generally we recommend candidates shoot for a score in the high 70s to low 80s to pass.""
Did you use a prep provider? No, I just used the study guide and found it to be very helpful and clear. However, they only provide 40 practice questions which really limited my studying.
Was the exam anything like the textbook or the mocks? Did you find it difficult? The exam was very similar to the practice questions, all multiple choice with some ""select two answer"" questions. It was pretty much identical in difficulty.
Other tips: I made a quizlet for the Check Your Understanding questions here and one for bolded terms here. I also found it useful to study the tables included in the study guide, which usually condensed some of the most important information.
Hey thanks so much for sharing. Could you by any chance share the exam study guide and any other material you have? Also, how much time would you say it takes to prepare for the exam? The website says 30 hours but that doesn't seem very realistic to me.
Thanks for sharing your quizlet! Looks like it took a lot of time so it’s much appreciated.
I took it a month ago and failed. Taking it again in a month. Questions were kinda brutal but I also realize now that I didn't study as deeply as I needed to. Lots of questions with multiple answers, and if you miss even one of the answers, you miss the whole question. God speed
Where did you read or find out that missing one of a multiple answer question makes the whole question wrong? Definitely a bummer because in a lot of the practice tests, I am getting at least one right.
When I took the actual exam - it says so before you begin the test.
I did retake the exam and passed. If you understand each practice question and why each answer is right (and why each answer is wrong), you'll be fine.
If you don't mind sharing, what was the score in both your attempts - pass and fail?
Awesome! Thanks for taking the time to respond!
I plan on taking it this summer, so I’ll let you know in a few months!
A co-worker of mine took them and said they provide you with a study book when you register, but there’s no prep course (or at least there wasn’t a few years ago).
Thanks! let me know!
Hey, I just took the exam on Friday and passed. The study book they provide does a great job of reviewing the material, but the questions on the exam can be very difficultly worded. That's what tripped me up the most.
All-in-all I'd say 45 or so hours of studying (I read the study book cover to cover, and I'm a slow reader). If you have an accounting background most of the concepts should come easily to you.
If you don't mind sharing, what is the score that you earned?

ESG Requirements in Employment,"For all of you who are responsible for evaluating candidates for ESG roles, what exactly are you looking for in a candidate?
In my undergrad, my alma mater did NOT offer a major in ""Sustainability"" ..I created my own. I have extensive experience that is applicable for ESG roles, but can't break-through to any of the companies I am applying for. Any help is greatly appreciated.","I understand getting to the interviews may be the challenge to begin with, but if you do.... Honestly? Real care and enthusiasm. If someone is a capable person and they are actually lit then the specifics of their qualifications matter a little less in my opinion.
I’ve been working in ESG on the buy side for a few years now and my best advice is to get most familiar with regulation affecting your specific slice of the financial markets. For example, know what UNPRI, TCFD, SFDR, SBTi, etc all entail for your company and your investments.
Every firm will have a different priorities for sustainability, whether they’re most concerned with E or S or G or what they want to target first. Knowing about standards and regulation will help as a baseline and then you learn as you go!
I’m with you on this and would like to know as well. Same for me in terms of experience. Never had a sustainability offering at school, but worked various jobs that all have a focus on ESG. I posted about this in this sub awhile ago and got some great advice about building a portfolio. For me that includes writing articles on ESG for a previous company I worked with. It was also recommended that you pursue certifications for ESG. That could range from coursera certifications or getting GRI certified. You could also start a blog to write about issues in ESG and share on LinkedIn. Like me, you may have experience that relates to ESG roles, but nothing with ESG in the title. Once recruiters start associating your name with ESG they’ll start to see you as an SME which can help. Take this as a grain of salt though since it sounds like we’re in the same boat
This is excellent advice - it makes sense to be a self starter here and probably always. Best of Luck to you!

Capitalizing on the tiniest of progress humanity has made against disaster
It’s a no from me
No offense, but you’re not speaking from the place of knowledge that you think you are. One of many articles on the topic:
https://magentaceiba.medium.com/refi-and-the-role-of-the-grassroots-b50dff20061b
This is not a convincing argument.
Financing can take place without this. Change can take place without this. Everything here hinges on the word voluntary- voluntary quantification and participation. Opting into and creating new markets where value is defined. New markets that have their own energy footprint, particularly blockchain related markets.
Societal decarbonization should not have to overcome all the hurdles we already have, plus new hurdles we place in our own path voluntarily because we think it will turn the engines of economics in the right direction. I see industries, real estate, investors, sitting up and realizing that a carbon-intensive asset now stands to transition into a liability. They’re ready to quantify, invest, change. Because of societal change, legal change, attitude change.
We have that power already; saying ‘we got this sorted but first we have to revolutionize financing’ is making this harder than it needs to be when it’s already a humanity-sized task.
…from my perspective, anyway.
Regarding your desire not to cause offense- you can tell me I am mistaken in my interpretation, or that there is new information I should have before making a decision, but you cannot tell me I do not have the knowledge that I have. That steps over a line into invalidating the experience and understanding of others. A friendly note for the future times you don’t mean to cause offense.
Another excellent piece that has shaped my thinking is A Case for Clean Money by Rune Christiansen, the founder of MakerDAO. LINK
MakerDAO’s DAI is a stablecoin pegged to $1 backed by a mixture of digital and as of relatively recently, physical assets.
In the link, Rune lays out a proposal to the community centered around the question “What if our unit of exchange wasn’t USD but a token backed by a basket of renewable energy assets, ethereum, and climate-related investments.” I think he makes an exciting argument for why it is not feasible and positive for the world.
Another thought to share regarding your concern on “why spend time making a new and complicated financial system when we already have one that works.”
For me, our financial system has failed to properly value the negative impact on our and our kids lives (not to mention the more than human world ) that’s coming from higher CO2 , plastics in the water, topsoil loss…
In our modern capitalistic world, we have a self-centered and near-sighted incentivization structure that rewards us when overlook the long term impacts of those negative externalities. I want a better system and I believe we have a chance that we could build it.
Kevin owocki has a book that dives into some of the new incentivation tools that modern cryptography enables called “greenpilled - why crypto can regenerate the world link
Core to Owocki / Karl Floresch / Vitalik Buterin and others idea is that an an individual’s behavior can be driven towards selfish decisions that are better for everyone if you reward the right behavior. The mechanism is through Retroactive Public Goods Funding.
Lastly, There’s an excellent podcast called Into the Bytecode - ep 1 is a conversation with floresch / buterin and the host about retroactive public goods funding and why they’re optimistic about the positive impact ethereum/crypto can have on the world.
Appreciate the feedback and for engaging!
Sounds like we both want to see our legacy systems decarbonized. I think we need the transparency on emissions that blockchains can enable. See this paper by Infosys on using blockchain to address scope 3 ghg Infosys. Also see what vechain is working on VeCarbon
To the energy concern: bitcoin - yes. Major issue . I don’t own any and won’t because it uses so much. However, the broader financial market place that’s being developed is on ethereum. It will have a negligible energy footprint once it switches to proof of stake in the next few months (99.98% energy reduction). Polygon, which many of the Regenerative financing protocols are built on, will have any even lower footprint because it scales on top of ethereum .
I see blockchain as a coordination tool to help address the tragedy of the commons that is climate . It’s definitely not the only tool, but it’s a compelling one.
John Ellison has an excellent overview of the ReFi world that addresses your concerns more eloquently than me (Ellison ReFi primer
Lastly, what we are trying to build is a currency that is backed by carbon sequestration rather than petroleum. I want the more of exchanging value to be one that resonates with my personal values - in a way that I’ve realized most fiat currency doesn’t.

I haven't really. I'm thinking of doing GRI to start since it seems more general, less accounting specific, and the fact that their testing schedule is limited in blocks of months.

Thinking about starting with GRI since they have a lot of free information and a cert for scope 3. Then I might look into a CFA certification to learn a little more technical training. I think both would improve my resume

Living in third world country (Honduras) : I would create a company to incentivize separation of plastics from all rest of the waste. I'll then use whatever plastic is useful (without chemical procedures) to build home composting products. The rest of the plastic should go through thermo-mechanical processes with machines bought with the money to recycle the plastic and build furniture (wastebins, chairs, benches) for public parks.
The home composting products would be sold at low cost and would include virtual conferences to educate people to reduce organic waste and incentivize the separation of metallic products (aluminium) and any carton/paper products. This will reduce waste significantly. (You can check out videos on rio Motagua in the Honduran Guatemalan frontier, and the waste being dispersed in the ocean).
With the compost, I'll incentivize growing trees for reforestation of many areaa devastation by deforestation.
I'll also create a company to recycle tires, to manufacture recycled tires. And if anything is left, I'd recover used oil to create biodiesel to power the company's transportation.

If you want a topic you can do easily then carbon is it, but its also the most mature area in the admittedly immature sustainability world. Probably the least advanced mainstream topic in the ESG spectrum is governance and thus the biggest place to look for gaps to fill

thats the titles of the podcasts you suggest me to listen ?
That’s all the articles they discussed in the podcast.
ah okay thank you
What’s the subject area mate? Might be able to help.
so something related to the stock returns of the company or their financial performance or smth similar
i dont have any boundaries. The research that I read so far was carbon premium around the world, do investors care about carbon risk?,firm commitments to reduce their csrbon emissions,Sustainability matter and financial performance of companies
All good topics! An interesting area to explore which should have more material may be the growth of sustainability linked lending/ green lending or green bonds. These are financial products and much is written about them/ there is reliable data for their deployment and use. You may also find it handy to look into the lack of a unified ESG metric - e.g why do we have international standardisation on many other key financial metrics (think GAAP accounting) but no standard approach to ESG? We don’t even have an agreed approach to ESG analysis of assets to produce a ‘green rating’ that is recognisable within national financial systems, never mind globally. This might lead you to consider how effective these are and how greenwashing works.
A separate area that is really interesting is the rise of Green Blockchains and the future of finance. A good place to start on that would be Algorand’s commitment to sustainability and comparing that with Ethereum/ Bitcoin to show how blockchains/ crypto are adapting to create a greener future!
thanks that sounds interesting. Do you know any particular research papers which I can read?
I don’t really, unfortunately - I’m a lawyer so I’ve been out of academia for a little while! Sorry! To the extent it helps lead to additional sources though, this is a good place to start for ESG in the UK: https://www.linklaters.com/en/client-services/environment-social-and-governance/sustainable-finance.
On the blockchain side, I’d recommend this as a place to start for an overview: https://www.coindesk.com/learn/can-crypto-go-green-how-to-invest-in-eco-friendly-cryptocurrencies/. In brief, blockchain is focused on the transition from Proof of Work (insanely bad for the environment) to Proof of Stake (actually, really quite low energy outputs - can use carbon offsets too)
Hope this is helpful! Good luck - would be good if you shared the article here when you’re done so we can see where you came out!
okay thanks for the help. Sure around summer it will be ready
These are really strong suggestions.

Corporate transition plans transparency - request for feedback,"Hi everyone,
After 20+ years in finance, we were frustrated that the level of transparency that we expect from financial statements is not being provided in terms of net-zero / impact plans. Me and some friends founded a startup that is focused on solving this problem, we want to make plans open and transparent.
Our product has simple goals:
Our product is free to the general public and if a company decides to share their data(which we believe is material, so public companies would have to). We have a team of people who gather this data for us and we have over 100 companies right now on our platform.
I need your help. I would love your feedback on our product and would be happy to hear your ideas on anything we can do to improve it. Our goal is for you to be able to make a judgement on if a company is doing enough and ideally, for people to start conversations with companies around it.
https://app.15rock.com/company/33 This is Amazon. Later this week we will release our dataset and are happy to take requests of companies you'd like.
","Also to restate - the tool will be free to the public and I'm not selling anything, just want feedback to help understand how we can make it as useful as possible to you to understand transition risk.
P.s. Although I appreciate the upvotes I'm getting here, I really want your thoughts! How can I make things easier for you!",1 year ago,"['Mon, Feb 21, 2022, 10:00:59 PM Central European Standard Time']",Startup / New Venture
Advice for getting into ESG consulting,"Like the title suggests, I’ve had a really hard time finding a career in ESG. I graduated from college back in 2019 with a finance degree and have only had the opportunity to work on a contract basis with a couple companies. I’m currently working for a renewable news organization that has hired me to write about the financial forces behind ESG. I have a great relationship with the owner who spoke to me about career paths and recommended I write this article in order to network with industry leaders.
I haven’t had any luck when applying for ESG related positions and after what feels like the 1000th rejection email which I received this morning, I’m feeling pretty demoralized in my career search. I have a pretty well rounded resume and it feels like I’ve done everything right so far: internships every summer during college, reaching out to my network, speaking with former professors, having random coffee meet ups. If I get lucky I’ll make it to the second interview, but then get rejected. I’m really starting to lose faith in my abilities and honestly don’t know what to do at this point.
Do any of you have any advice for networking or interview tips? I’m specifically interested in remote opportunities.
Forgot to mention I’m based in the United States","This won't be what you want to hear but we have interviewed over 200 investors for our product. Everyone from ESG heads to front office teams.
In finance, it's still finance first then ESG. Many of the ESG leads who are not well versed on finance seem to be having trouble convincing the company to change, and there is alot of resistance within the folks on the ground. The groups that I have seen make progress seem to have domain knowledge in the business first then learned ESG.
In terms of ESG, you can do the GRI and CFA course if you like, it would give you a good background but you should leverage some domain knowledge, even if you are early in your career you can leverage your interests to gain influence over the decision-makers and find the right about of change the org is willing to go through on their current ESG journey.
Best of luck!
Thanks for the insight! Another commenter had mentioned trying to pursue as many side projects as possible just to add to my portfolio which I think is a great idea. Currently writing an article with a few other team members and I’ll be focusing on the finance side so hopefully that’ll help. I think you make a good point about the difficulties in persuading upper management to make these sweeping changes without highlighting the financial benefit.
As a side note I saw your recent post in this sub and your venture sounds really interesting. Best of luck!
Thank you so much!
For what it's worth, I think a career in ESG is going to be one of the best options possible. It's going to have a material impact on the world but is very very complicated when the rubber hits the road so you'll have endless challenges.
The ESG community is very nice and I would suggest you reach out to anyone you find interesting. You'd be surprised who will give you the time of day to help you. Publish your work and share your ideas. If I can help do let me know!
I’m honestly blown away by the positivity of folks in this industry. I feel like because of the positive impact it has it’s bound to attract people who have a desire to do some good and they’re more likely to help where they can. LinkedIn has become my best friend through this time and I agree with you people are nearly always happy to have a conversation.
You’ve helped a lot just by sharing your perspective and advice, although if you happen to be aware of any vacancies that allow for remote work please reach out! I’m still stuck in that “trying to get your foot in the door” phase
ok I'll keep my eyes open. To be honest, these kind of roles don't appear on my radar since we work with more senior folks to help reduce or assess transition risk but I'll ask how someone can get their foot in the door.
Many ESG heads are constantly looking for talent and since they are more or less support roles to the core business their budgets are usually limited so someone like you would be ideal.
I suggest you share your work with them, get on a call and ask them to give you a chance..even if it's freelancing/contract it helps you build your experience.
Or just start your own mini consulting firm. I've met people who are PR people and good at writing who started firms to help corporations manage their ESG narrative - that could be an option also as you seem to have the writing experience in ESG.
Hey no worries! I still really appreciate the advice and for keeping an eye out.
That seems to be what I’ve been told. It still seems like a pretty competitive field, but other redditors have reassured me that continuing to freelance/contract will lead to a great opportunity. The past few years have been very challenging, but I’m grateful for the learning experience it’s afforded me.
I actually have started a consulting firm! My clients are basically all small business owners and I’ve really focused on suggesting sustainable solutions to help their businesses, but I really need to build out the website portion of my business
Awesome. That’s so great to hear.
Don’t over think the site. Webflow and use a google form to survey or generate leads. Our platform will have a section for consultants soon. I can let you know as companies and investors have been asking us to help create projects for them but that’s not our skill set so we are just going help people use our platform to connect.
Study about various reporting format like GRI and IR then you will able to understand about ESG ..
I work in the field of human rights and environmental due diligence (basically what a company does to know/show that it's addressing ESG problems in its operations and its supply chains). Within companies, the positions that deal with this are usually ""sustainability officers"" or sometimes in supply chain management or a division within legal or government affairs. You also have a lot of industry associations that provide support, auditing, and certification programs for Responsible Supply Chains. The big one I know of is the Responsible Business Alliance, but there are plenty. I work on conflict minerals specifically and there are a ton of smaller consultancies that provide this type of supply chain management service to companies and I've seen many on LinkedIn recently with job postings (see Levin Sources, Kumi Consulting, The Dragonfly Initiative, CSR Europe, BSR, etc). Send me a DM and we can chat in more detail.
I'd say you're currently on the right track since you already have an ESG-related job. Keep building your experience in ESG topics and maybe do some sustainability-related side projects if you could. More experience always helps during job seeking. For example, having 3 years of experience opens up a lot more job opportunities than just 1-2 years. Getting certification and learning additional language will also help as long it's relevant.
Based on my experience, try to find if anyone within your network has a referral program in their consulting firm. It is an initiative where an employee recommends their friend or ex-colleague to the recruitment team. I found that my chance to get called to be much higher if I was referred by an insider compared to if I apply the job through normal means (via linkedin, company website, etc).
Finally, good luck and don't give up! Taking a break from job seeking for like 1-3 months to focus on something else would also be fine if you're currently too stressed about it.
Maybe getting an MBA with sustainability concentration. Would also give you flexibility to explore other roles while bringing a sustainablity lense
Do you hold any certifications like the SASB FSA level I or II?
And just on a speculative not, there might be considerable competition for those positions from established professionals. Which is not to say you should give up, just to recognize it most likely has nothing to do with you and in time you’ll be qualified/over-qualified.
I don’t, but I’ve certainly considered obtaining it along with a GRI certification. Good place to start?
You’re probably right about the other applicants. It sure gets frustrating trying to gain more experience while competing with people who have more experience haha
Yeah GRI would be a great idea. So keep your chin up! And best of luck nailing the dream job.

Effective ethical personal divesting and/or shareholder advocacy?,"What are your guidelines for effective ethical personal divestment and/or shareholder advocacy beyond just selling shares when a company and/or its leadership breaches your ethical standards?
E.g. Elon Musk's labor + workplace racial issues and experiments on other animals
The sentiment and maybe actual impact of Tesla seems good and yet it doesn't feel likely that speaking out as someone with a few shares and withdrawing my money would go far in terms of accountability on Musk and the company.
It feels disingenuous to simply sell and be profiting just as it becomes clear that someone with a billionaire's cushion at the helm is not on the right track.
And this could be said for other companies too. Chipotle seemed like it was off to a good start but their labor practices are under issue right now. Or major multinational corporations like a Unilever or even a Hershey's where the possibility of human rights violations or even slavery in the supply chain still exists.
And while I've participated in other kinds of advocacy, shareholder meetings are sort of foreign to me, and it's rare to find activists the way we normally would with NGOs that shepherd folks together for a cause or grassroots efforts which can do the same.

At first glance looks like a scheme to make money from people who want to do real good by fooling them
OP here. We're incentivizing companies to do better by making their impact performance public, transparent and comparable. At the moment, nobody knows how Tesla is doing impact-wise compared to Pfizer. All we have are lengthy corporate reports and biased analyses. With our open-to-all platform, everybody gets a say and can rate companies' impact performance. That's a big step ahead in a field where common standards are missing. And it is the necessary step to allow investors to put their money where the impact truly is.
Hi OP.
Apologies if I've misunderstood. Admittedly I've not read all your literature, so could be missing something
Hi again. First of all, thanks for taking the time to voice your concerns. This is super valuable to us. We're a startup and nothing is set in stone. So we do consider everything you say and take it seriously.
Now let me quickly address your 4 points.
Thanks for your response. I apologise for missing that you were free to the user. I still feel confused as to how the companies would be impacted by why you're doing. Also unclear how you'd avoid people gaming your system. Good luck, your heart seems to be in the right place
Thanks for this! Companies would not be directly impacted by what we're doing. They are not directly impacted if their stock prices rises or falls either. Still, they are heavily impacted by the signal a rising or falling stock price sends - and the same applies for the prices on Echo. With a simple and comparable real-time measure for a company's impact in place, those institutional investors who care about sustainable/ethical investments will allocate their money accordingly. And that's what impacts the companies.
As for the peopel gaming our system: the easiest way to avoid being gamed is a big, enthusiastic user base. We'd be happy to welcome you on Echo! You've probably seen that you directly sign up for pre-registration on our page: echo-exchange.com

Calculate impact based on investment in funds and ETFs?,"Hi everyone,
For research I was wondering if its possible to calculate your impact when investing in thematic ETFs or funds? Now or in the future?
To be more concrete: could I calculate howmuch CO2 I saved by investing in a clean energy ETF? Eg. Based of GHG emissions (scope 1-3)","
One thing I have seen is an ESG index which ranks various ETFs and other securities in bands (a bit like credit ratings). Underneath those are the reports given by the ETF/ securities - MSCI has one of these. One of the issues though, is that there doesn’t appear to be any uniform way of reporting ESG targets (unlike say, GAAP accounting) so it is hard to verify how accurate the actual reporting is… in turn meaning your analysis may not actually derive a meaningful answer because of the inherent issues in the underlying data.
Ethosesg.com
Its implied impact, not direct
You can’t. If you invest in an etf you are buying shares from another person. No money goes to the companies, they don’t do more or less for the environment if you do or don’t invest. Investing your values is important but it does not lead to you being to point to a counter factual to measure against
It is and hopefully the metrics will improve.

Using a carbon negative blockchain to fundraise for environmentally focused groups - please let us know what you think,"Hey everybody, hope you’re having great weekends! We have come up with a bespoke way of fundraising for environmentally focused groups, as well as providing a free to use education resource - we called it SeedBomb. We think profit making is good as long as it is more directly linked to improving the world we live in. In a nutshell, we have two key areas we hope you’d be interested in:
a) to use a carbon negative blockchain to raise funds which are then donated/ granted to eco projects. Our community suggests potential beneficiaries of these funds, they are then reviewed by our committee (to check they’re legitimate) before being put to a final community vote on how funds are allocated.
b) we want to build a free educational resource for anyone to use that covers green topics. We’d hope some of you may want to work with our committee to produce articles. In exchange, we put it on our social media and website, writers retain all rights to it and we send you some of our currency.
Basically we all feel a bit powerless about the current situation and want to try and do something about it. The Algorand blockchain gives us a great chance to do that.

While there are many existing resources out there for accredited investors, we're trying to build a go-to, unbiased, and ad-free resource for everyone else (e.g., non-accredited with limited assets).
You can find our website at: https://virtuescout.com/.
Currently, we have about 20 products with a few more to be published soon, but I'm hoping this community might know of some products we're missing that we could add? And of course, we'd love to hear any feedback in general!
The only exceptions are:
Thank you in advance for any feedback!","This is quite interesting!
Some initial thoughts:
Overall, this is a great initiative! Keep up the good work.
Thanks for the kind words and feedback!
Currently, our ratings are qualitative rather than quantitative, but we do have an internal rating methodology. I think that's a great idea to publish that methodology to provide greater transparency—and I've added that to our roadmap now! We are also working on writing (and updating) reviews on each product to provide greater insight into the rating.
That said, one challenge we have is balancing the rating to reflect both financial return and impact. We may separate these out into two ratings or make the star rating an impact rating while moving financial returns to the filter menu.
If you are able to come up with a fair way to balance returns with ""greenness"" or ""socialness"" then you will really have a product (or rather a methodology) which could be worth a lot of money and create a lot of impact. It's an area that is simply lacking in the sustainable finance world...we need better data (and real-time) and software, but it is an important nut to crack!
Does this include the “S” in ESG or just the “E”? If so there are gender equality ETFs to consider
Yes, our goal is to include products that meet ESG plus any of the UN SDGS. While we have some ""social"" products, such as CNote, we hadn't thought of gender equality ETFs, so thank you for the suggestion! We will add those to the list.
Very cool! For what it’s worth there are some here:

Take a look at Moodys, S&P, and MSCI sustainability / ESG websites. Then get them to give you a demo of their products and use the opportunity to ask the questions you need to.
From my understanding, the ESG/Sustainability frameworks/metrics are constantly evolving. They are still on their road to harmonization. In fact, the IFRS just announced a new international standard like the IASB for sustainability reporting, called the ISSB, in COP26. That being said, I think it's strategically better to get the knowledge straight from the current sustainable finance networks. In my opinion, the best one is UNPRI. They have all the resources you need from the lastest news and opinions, to academic research papers and case studies available on their website, and it's free.

Apart from a cleaner environment for us to live in, I don't expect major changes to the sceneries. Financial institutions are just enablers. Sustainable finance is one tool to force companies to have more stringent ESG considerations into business operations.
Essentially we are already at 100% sustainable finance since major banks do have ESG policy. We are just moving the goalposts every year based on societal or regulatory requirements.

TCFD - the most important disclosure?,,,u/[deleted],[],Discussion / Question
Any idea?,To what extend and why do you think that firms have a responsibility to the society and not to their shareholders only? Which aspects are of particular relevance and why?,"Its a difficult question that has seen much debate, but it is very relevant for the shape of sustainable finance.
There is the legal angle (firms as legal constructs) and there is the moral / social angle: firms as sets of people who derive and provide benefits and incur obligations versus other stakeholders (both those currently living and all future generations).

The legal angle is inadequate, because reality is always reflected poorly in law and powerful economic interests can distort the legal system (regulatory and political capture) without regard to so-called ""externalities""
In the end firms, markets, contracts, regulation etc are just invented societal tools. What really matters is the moral backbone of society and in particular how short-termist, greedy and how aware of the common destiny, dependencies and systemic vulnerabilities created by such behavior.
If the right moral values prevail it is a massive but tractable and gainful exercise to adjust the scaffolding of the economy to serve them.

Looking for beta testers for impact investing data app,"Hi everyone, Hope this is allowed.
I’m part of a team who is about to launch a free impact investing data app and we are looking for beta testers to test it out before hand.
We provide data on CO2 emissions, info on gender equality and independence in the boards, executive-to-employee pay ratio, and more. We are trying to go beyond the traditional ESG scores or ratings and provide data that retail investors can use to take decisions and form opinions.
Right now we have data on the S&P 500 companies but will keep on expanding the universe of stocks we offer data on.
We are planning on proving portfolio impact analysis as well, based on the data we have.
Just let me know if you’d like to try it out before we release it and be part of the creation of (hopefully) a tool to make impact investing a lot easier for everybody.
Or if you’d like to see/read more on what we are doing here is a link to the website: Finuprise","yes would like to test the app.

Negative CO2 carbon footprint under SFDR?,"Hi everyone,
I’ve a question about carbon footprint reporting under SFDR. If I understood it correctly every fund should report their carbon footprint per year. I would suspect that impact investment funds would have a negative carbon footprint. This would allow me to calculate the co2 print of my investment portfolio.
Can somebody who has looked into the SFDR give their opinion on this?
Thanks a lot!","In order for you to reach a negative figure, you would most likely need to refer to Avoided Emissions as an indicator.
SFDR requires Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions neither of which really are avoided emissions as the least value (to me, personally) there would be zero. This has been an age-old debate in the industry and there is a concept around ""Scope 4"" but nothing concrete.
Emission offsets done at a fund level would not qualify to reduce your fund footprint.
If we are talking about shorts (i assume we're not given your impact reference but hey), then those can be netted off according to the latest guidance, which could put you into negative emissions.
Good luck with the SFDR implementation, we'll get through it!
Thanks a lot for the response. Indeed we’ll probably manage to implement it but too bad it will be hard to show what the impact of your investment on the climate or society is.",2 years ago,[],Discussion / Question

Thank you!","Sustainable cost accounting might be something to look into, I've come across a few articles about it recently and it seems to be gaining traction.
It does not sound too innovative but I would say setting up and executing a product change strategy is a good project. Too many firms focus on creating a few overly fancy sus products for ad campaigns while ignoring the in time transition of what is already there.

The “Next Big Thing” in Green Finance: Valuing Biodiversity,,"I would simply and sincerely say, that a far better way to approach this topic is to phrase it as 'RESPECTING BIODIVERSITY'. Tying a monetary tag to forms of life will only condemn more species to extinction, replaced by other low-value items. This IS just the way things work.
The modern financial system is simply incapable to integrate considerations that are not expressed in monetary values. The only real way to shape its ""value system"" is via regulation and the legal system (by creating ""no-go"" zones). Even then, if the penalties are not draconian, it will simply turn them into a ""cost-of-business"" calculations.
This does not imply that it is intrinsically ""evil"". A powerful but limited tool (monetization / financialization / marketization) has been overused to a degree that it become self-destructive.

Sustainable investments are most of the time not sustainable,"I work at a large asset manager and as at almost all financial institutions sustainability is at the top of the agenda. With new laws and labels popping up left and right it feels like almost every company can find a way to classify their funds as sustainable, towards sustainability or other buzzwords. If you look at the allocations of these funds then you will see that companies such as microsoft, apple, … will pop-up in almost all funds.
This makes me very sceptical when I see the term sustainable in finance or investments as I really have the feeling that companies are managing to greenwash their activity by finding a way to classify it under sustainability. Do you guys have similar experiences?","Are you sure you're not mixing up the expectations you're having from a sustainable investment vs an impact investment, Mr. asset manager?
The purpose of sustainable investments is to generate return while minimising the sustainability risks and ensuring minimum to no harm.
Unless I have missed out something significant, then Microsoft and Apple aren't poor performers on ESG characteristics, but damn are you screwed for performance if you don't hold them. So could you please explain where is the issue there?
Now, if you are expecting to generate positive sustainability impacts and earn some alongside of it, there's a specific category for that dubbed impact investing. You'll mostly be looking at either deep theme funds, concentrated holdings (usually in small-mid cap space), and/or private investments/VC. Not quite the usual risk-return profiles for the common retail investor, right?
One helpful way to look at it is to consider: is the fund pretty general, but excluding (a range of) unsustainable businesses, or is the fund very specifically only including those companies that are deemed sustainable.
Most 'sustainable' funds are the of the first type, which explain why you still see all those big tech companies that are not necessarily sustainable.
For both types there is a use: the first is still a general fund covering most of the market (except of course the 'bad' practices), the second is specifically sustainable, and more appropriate to have on the side of your more general market mix.
Yeah we know. I'm into the FIRE movement some I haven't got much choice othe Ethan to put my money into something that might force other companies to change their way or at least on the books and make themselves look more green.
Yup, be it it's pretty easy to look up morningstar /MSCI / as you sow data and eyeball the holdings to see how far it goes. If you buy a greenwashed sustainable investment fund, it's because you didn't take 5 minutes to analyze what you're buying.
The problem is that most individuals go to their local bank or broker and they give a nice pitch how their fund is sustainable. These individuals don’t look at the allocations of the funds. I’m really wondering when people will start to realize this.
At the same time I’m thinking about starting a site which breaks down the actual sustainability of all investment funds available via the banks in my country.

"Opinion | This Movement Is Taking Money Away From Fossil Fuels, and It’s Working",,"And it’s costing us a fortune
Could you post/comment the text of the article?
I remember the night in the autumn of 2012 when the first institution in the U.S. publicly committed to divest from fossil fuel. I was with a group of other climate activists in a big theater in Portland, Maine, halfway through a monthlong road show with rallies in cities across the country, and the president of tiny Unity College in the state’s rural interior announced to the crowd that his trustees had just voted to rid their endowment of coal, gas and oil stocks. We cheered like crazy.
On Tuesday, a little less than a week before the start of the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow, activists announced that the fossil fuel divestment campaign has reached new heights. Endowments, portfolios and pension funds worth just shy of $40 trillion have now committed to full or partial abstinence from coal, gas and oil stocks. For comparison’s sake, that’s larger than the gross domestic product of the United States and China combined.
It’s gone far beyond Unity College. Institutions such as Oxford and Cambridge (and more than half the public universities in the United Kingdom) have committed to divest; so have the University of California and the University of Michigan. Most of the Ivies are on board now, as are Catholic powerhouses like Georgetown; in the last couple of months, places as diverse as Harvard, Loyola University Chicago and Oregon’s Reed College have joined in.
My own employer, Middlebury College, agreed to divest in 2019, following a six-year campaign by students and faculty. But many schools have yet to act. The very first college to face divestment demands — Swarthmore, in Pennsylvania — has yet to make the commitment, and the same is true of plenty of others who should know better (Yale and Princeton, say).
And by this point, divestment has spread way beyond colleges and universities. Enormous pension funds serving New York City and state employees have announced that they will sell stocks; earlier this year, the Maine legislature ordered the state’s retirement fund to divest; and just last month, Quebec’s big pension fund joined the tide. We’ve seen entire religious groups — the Episcopalians, the Unitarian Universalists, the U.S. Lutherans — join in the call; the Pope has become an outspoken proponent (and many high-profile Catholic institutions have announced they will divest). Mayors of big cities have pledged their support, including Los Angeles, New York, Berlin and London. And an entire country, even: Ireland has announced it will divest its public funds.
And some of the most historically important investors in the world have joined in too: A Rockefeller charity, the heirs to the first great oil fortune, divested early. Just last week, the Ford Foundation got in on the action, adding a great automotive fortune to the tally. This month also saw the first big bank — France’s Banque Postale — announce that it would stop lending to fossil fuel companies before the decade was out.
Since most people don’t have oil wells or coal mines in their backyards, divestment is a way to let a lot of people in on the climate fight, because they have a link to a pension fund, mutual fund, endowment or other pot of money. When we began the divestment campaign, our immediate goal was, as we put it, to “take away the social license” of Big Oil: It was a vehicle to let people know the essential truth about the fossil fuel industry, which is that its oil, gas and coal reserves held five times as much carbon as scientists said we could safely burn. Later this week, the heads of the big oil companies will testify before Congress about whether their companies misled the public about global warming and sought to stymie action on the problem.
The movement has grown so large that it’s now also testing the ability of some companies to raise capital. As early as 2017, Peabody was listing divestment as a major concern; by the next year, Shell was warning shareholders that the campaign could have a “material adverse effect on the price of our securities and our ability to access equity capital markets.”
Early divestment adopters have been handsomely rewarded; over the last five years, the market has gone up at an annual rate of 16 percent, but the oil and gas sector has fallen at an annual rate of 3 percent. Now many investors are putting their money into clean energy, where returns have risen by an annual rate of 22 percent over the same period. And one other sweet result: It was largely alumni of college divestment fights who formed the Sunrise Movement, a group of young climate activists, and championed the proposed Green New Deal; this has been a training ground for activists around the world.
This campaign still has a lot of work to do. Huge fights are underway in the teachers’ pension funds for New York and California; for financial giants like T.I.A.A., which maintains retirement accounts for educators and many others; and pretty much anywhere else where money and morality coincide. Yes, other people buy stocks when institutions divest, but, as The Times pointed out recently, it’s private equity funds that have invested at least $1.1 trillion into the energy sector since 2010, overwhelmingly in fossil fuels, trying to make a short-term killing.
The battle to wind down the fossil fuel industry proceeds on two tracks: the political (where this week may or may not see action on big climate legislation from Congress) and the financial. Those tracks cross regularly — the influence of money in politics is clear on energy legislation — and when we can weaken the biggest opponents of climate action, everything gets easier. Divestment has helped rub much of the shine off what was once the planet’s dominant industry. If money talks, $40 trillion makes a lot of noise.

Crypto enthousiasts will pitch their wares at every opportunity. Not sure if we should introduce a ""no crypto"" rule. Implicitly we are covered by the ""no noise"" rule. Its up to the community, if people feel the sub is abused to promote crypto please speak up. There is a remote chance that some developments might be relevant.
I second this
Hey there! This is a great idea! However, if you are looking at investing in cryptocurrencies, I would also check out Proof of Stake blockchains. There are lots of networks and technologies out there that are more sustainable ecologically. There are also a lot of chains, protocols, and technologies in development that could also provide economic sustainability globally.
Exactly, the Ethereum Blockchain is on the verge of reducing the emissions of its transactions by 99% compared to current levels by switching from proof of work (what Bitcoin uses) to proof of stake. It will also be able to carry low carbon Bitcoin transaction thanks to the wrapped Bitcoin cryptocurrency (WBTC).
Yeah there are plenty of block chains that are doing that as well. Harmony is a low emission network that is releasing a BTC bridge next month. Cardano, Solana, Algorand, Elrond, etc. are all networks that are Proof of Stake that all include fast transactions, low fees, and low emissions

Best certification for sustainable finance investing?,Hi - I’ve been in the corporate governance space for a long while and I am hoping to broaden out my knowledge of the rest of esg. Does anyone have any recommendations for courses on sustainable investing/analysis?,"You can consider getting the Certified ESG Analyst (CESGA) by the EFFAS. It's recognized and accredited in the EU. I got that one back in June this year.
Second this one, also a Cesga holder
Agree with above comment on CFA ESG. Some other good courses from recognized organizations are:
UNPRI Academy
https://priacademy.org/
The PRI Academy was developed to train financial services, corporate and other professionals seeking to understand how environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues impact company performance, shareholder value and investment decision making.
SASB Fundamentals of Sustainability Accounting
https://fsa.sasb.org/credential/
The FSA Credential is designed for professionals who benefit from understanding the link between financially material sustainability information and a company’s ability to drive enterprise value. The majority of test takers are professionals in investment analysis, consulting, and corporate sustainability.
TCFD Courses
https://www.tcfdhub.org/online-courses/
The climate-related financial disclosure online courses are designed to help organizations fill the knowledge gap and enhance their disclosures of climate-related information. These courses are suitable for anyone interested in learning more about climate-related disclosure and the TCFD.
GRI Academy
https://www.globalreporting.org/reporting-support/gri-academy/#
Online learning for sustainability professionals
Stay ahead of the curve with the GRI Academy. We offer opportunities for professional development alongside the latest sustainability-related curriculum including the GRI Professional Certification program, online training courses, tutorials and webinars. Learn from experts and interact with peers at the forefront of sustainability reporting.
All four of these are from organizations that I've encountered at work (buy-side ESG analysis). I haven't done any of them myself but have only heard good things.
CFA ESG very basic but good starting point
How do you feel about the FSA credential vs CFA ESG? Does it make sense to do both?
I have no direct experience with the FSA no mr heard about anyone who has, would be curious to. Since the CFA is well recognised for their usual investment certificates, it worked great to facilitate my transition into ESG. If that’s your objective too, one should be enough, and then you only really learn through practice

ESG article by Vox. Thoughts?,,"Good share.
On the one hand its a bit of a luxury problem. Greenwashing is only possible in a world that actually values sustainability (but doesn't quite yet have the tools to ensure it).
On the other hand its pretty clear that individual investments can go only so far. Sustainability requires a holistic approach, behavioral change, corporate incentive changes, regulatory change etc.
We are at the beginning of a journey and most important developments still ahead of us.
Agreed.
Besides moral or ethical reasons, I think (true) ESG can be a genuinely good investment too. For example, I’m in my 20s and long term I don’t see fossil fuels holding up. Obviously, fossil fuels are unlikely to collapse anytime soon, but at some point in my lifetime I think (hope?) it won’t be a good investment anymore.
Especially if people chose to put their money in banks like Aspiration, with others following suit, who make sure it doesn't get invested in the fossil-fuel sector
My take on ESG investing is that it is a good tool for risk management in public markets but to truly make an impact, public markets may not be the best place. There is an argument for ESG and alignment with values when it comes to Fixed Income IMO since those are earmarked for specific things.
What do you think of the VOTE ETF?
I think the premise of it is good but the execution is not so much. Active ownership and voting with your shares is a good place to have a real impact in public equity, I do agree with that. I think the mission of the VOTE ETF gets lost when you take small positions in 500 companies... Why not concentrate that capital into 10-20 companies, gain a more significant share and be able to have more votes. Feels a little greenwashy and unrealistic to be voting across 500 companies.

‘Green growth’ doesn’t exist – less of everything is the only way to avert catastrophe | George Monbiot,,"These takes/positions are so unproductive, we are at the point where green growth HAS to work. If you understand how people work, making people cut back forcefully, instead of through innovation and increased efficiency, will be viewed as oppression. I am not saying I agree with that point of view but it's how people work. Once someone has something good and then it's taken away, people will inherently be upset and view it as oppression. The only way to do this would be some program where people's consumption is monitored which that obviously would get weird also. If such a system were to arise, you should expect fervent opposition to these new measures. And given how human nature is, most people would probably support the opposition. Then we would go down an even darker path because people will relate climate efforts with ""socialist totalitarian nightmares"" and further ignore our climate issues. This is basically what has been happening with climate issues for the last 20-30 years. Politicians/scientists come out with these grand claims about the end of the world (which I know are real) but then someone finds 1 shred of misinformation and the whole thing collapses and climate science is labeled ""alarmist"". It sucks but given how we have been raised and how people are consuming less is very unrealistic. If green growth isn't working then we need to find a way to make it fucking work because it's the only shot we have.

Anyways lets hope we can figure this shit out
Thanks for a very thoughtful comment and indeed you point out something to really worry about. For starters, I do think Monbiot is spot-on in pointing out how the sustainability challenge is more global, pervasive and complex than what is presented. Its not just CO2 emissions that is the current talking point, its our enormous and growing footprint on the bioshpere that has sprung disasters before (e.g the CFC/ozone story) and will do so, again from many unexpected corners.
Once we acknowledge the dire circumstances in their fullnes, the response is entirely up to us. Indeed green growth must work, it is not optional. I think it can work. ""growth"" is a vague term. It has been tied to absurdly limiting metrics like GDP or market capitalizations and economic theories/ practices that are simply not-fit-for-purpose and we must at some point call them out for what they are: A danger to literally all of us and all future generations.
What matters is well being. Expanding material consumption is easy GDP growth but its link with well being is not monotonic. I could list countless of ways that we can increase well being without increasing footprint. From education, to health, to entertainment and so on. Inventing low footprint / circular construction, manufacturing etc is a growth industry in itself. And the digital economy (if we ignore coin miners) is inherently more efficient.
In any case, one thing we should absolutely not do is to be paralysed into assuming that the concepts, theories, mindsets etc that seemed to sort of work for some small fraction of the 20th century is all there is in how people can organize themselves.

Are ‘Green Banks’ Really Better for the Environment?,"Scientific American came out with an interesting read I think, and since a lot of the green banking angle is currently focused on the financing of fossil-fuels I thought it may be of interest here.
There's an interesting discussion there about the importance, or sometimes lack thereof, of retail clients and the challenge of making big banks shift into greener mindsets and practices. But they are dreaming big nonetheless, or as Ivan Frishberg, an executive vice president and director of impact policy at Amalgamated Bank said “We’re trying to move the whole ecosystem”.
He further suggests advocates and climate-focused firms both be working to generate “a whole societal conversation about what is the license we gave to these banks and does it include funding this stuff that’s going to kill us"".
Coming at the finance strikes me as a difficult, yet potentially devastating attack against fossil fuels, would be dope to hear your thoughts.","Banks are famously intermediaries so there is a fundamental constraint that they cannot be (collectively) more ""green"" than the society and economy they operate in.
But banks are also supposed to be good at risk management, which in this context means assessing and pricing the risks of unsustainable environmental practices.
If they neglect this duty on an ongoing basis it can only be on the basis of moral hazard, a manifestation of the tragedy of the horizon, and an assumption that stranded assets will in due course be bailed out directly by the collective.",2 years ago,"['Tue, Sep 21, 2021, 02:00:06 PM Central European Summer Time']",Discussion / Question

Drake Wants to Turn His Life Carbon Neutral with Aspiration Bank,"Drake, along with Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert Downey Jr & Orlando Bloom, are all invested in the green, fintech bank Aspiration (ticker: ASP, NYSE), which goes public in the coming months.
Drake will practice Aspiration’s individual and enterprise assistance to observe and cut down his duplicate step, the company’s execs say, to make his intimate life carbon neutral.
Some fun fact on sustainable neobank Aspiration:
1.) Grew from 1.7 million users in 2020 to 5 million users in 2021
2.) Plants trees every time you make a transaction and round up to the nearest dollar
3.) Against the funding of fossil fuels
4.) New credit cards made from recycled plastic
Very green and is on a fast growing path since last year. Looks to me like a very interesting stock to look into! Would love to hear thoughts from others about this company and how you think their stock will perform when they go public.","Like the effort and am curious about Aspiration myself
Drake will be a registered child lover before he’s able to complete this goal.
Lol XD Honestly, if he wasn't partnered with Aspi I would say the same thing. Contracts got commitments
I looked at Aspiration but honestly Ando seemed better suited for me.
Wait I didn’t know they even existed. I went from Wells Fargo (ignorance) to Aspiration in January this year but now I’m wondering if I should open another account with Ando since there’s no fee, and I don’t use Aspiration’s save account because it’s not free to have any amount of APY (gotta pay for it which negates any interest you’d have made since their rate is low). Thank you for this comment, I wish I’d known sooner. Only thing is I wanted to wait til I saw what Aspiration’s credit card will be like, it hasn’t come out yet but they announced it a few months ago. That and I don’t see reviews for Ando anywhere but there is decent reviews for Aspiration so that’s probably why I picked it too",2 years ago,"['Tue, Sep 14, 2021, 01:25:59 PM Central European Summer Time']",

people don't appreciate how primitive actually the science of economics compared to other knowledge domains. thats because of the siloed way knowledge has been pursued in the last couple of centuries. all scientistis get Nobel prizes (on a relative curve), but some domains are still arguing like alchemists.
the number of ""blind spots"" and absurd assumptions in economics is just incredible. it is also a key reason for so much friction in political discourse. for example the famous ""the business of business is profit"" dictum is based on the implicit assumption that morality and legality coincide. never mind that corruption and capture of government and legal systems is the rule, not the exception

How to green your bank? Does it matter?,"One thing the latest IPCC report makes loud and clear is the importance of rapidly reversing our dependence on fossil fuels.
So I'm curious to hear how you all think about our role as consumers. I've been taking a look at how our savings and investments might be financing fossil fuels. So I've taken steps to close my accounts with banks that are the largest funders of fossil fuels. I'm also now shifting my retirement savings to fossil fuel free funds.
I found this blog pretty helpful in getting me started: https://www.joro.tech/joro-blog/how-to-take-climate-action-green-finance-banking
Would love to hear what others have done?","Some of the consumer-friendly green neobanks are:
- Aspiration (most established, many perks, like ""plant your change"", up to 1% APY)
- Ando Money (provides a breakdown through the app of exactly what deposits are funding though recently had customer service issues)
- ATMOS (savings accounts only for the moment, also show you what your deposits are funding)
- Amalgamated Bank (New York-based, carbon-neutral)
- Climate First Bank (new ""green"" bank launched in Florida, but APY is low)
- First Green Bank (Florida-based, few branches, very low APY)
Green banks have become a hot new trend, and I've been seeing new green banks all over the US, and even around the globe.
You got (just off the top of my head) Green Penny, NY State Green Bank, Aspiration Bank, Amalgamated Bank, Bank of England, Bank of Australia, TriodosUK, DC Green Bank and Acorns.
Hopefully you'll find the one that works for you! Just got to do some research :)
It definitely does matter! We need to defund fossil fuels, that or a new law will be the only way to get rid of them and the pollution they cause to our planet. I've been with Aspiration, they're a green, online bank that don't fund fossil fuels and plant trees when you buy things (only if you round up your purchase to the dollar). They've been a great bank for me so far :)
Choosing ""green"" banks means puting money where our mouth is. Money has no color but our planet does: whether it is in its natural blue/green or our degraded brown/gray, this is a collective choice.
We should just keep in mind that sustainability is a marathon not a sprint; many solutions still to be discovered / perfected; any project / investment has risk; greenwashing is an issue; greenmania / hype will be abused by shortterm operators etc.
In my country we have two green banks. My savings account is at one of them. It's a nice idea that my savings are invested into responsible projects. Whether it makes a difference? The effect of my lonely account is probably insignificant. But with enough people moving their banking, other banks will move towards greener behaviour just to not lose customers.
I mean I use an online bank of course (Ally) but I don’t think individuals detaching themselves from a bank (low net worth individuals actually usually lose banks money by the way..) will have any impact whatsoever.
The financial industry, no matter which bank it is specifically, will continue financing fossil fuels anyway. As long as theirs money to be made. To divest from fossil fuels, ditch your car, make sure you buy your energy from a solar or wind energy producer if you can choose, and push for a carbon tax. This shit is noise.
Short answer: Banks in generally are doing the minimal. There is no great financial benefits for them to do better. Everything is running under the pretense that banks are complying to the laws and regulations, or even supporting national interests. So that is the area environmentalists should focus.

YOUR OPINION: How can your actions directly contribute to sustainability and climate protection?,"Hey Folks!
Im glad to hear some opinions from you... Do you think its possible that your actions (in form of sustainable investment decisions) can directly contribute to more sustainability and clime protection? If so: how?","Individual decisions that get replicated over large numbers can easily make an impact. E.g. every single person (that can afford to own a house) pays for heating, or airconditioning (or both). By selecting the type of these amenities they are making investment decisions with significant cumulative impact.
I firmly believe it can nowadays, in more ways than one. Depending on where you are you now have ways to divest from fossil fuels, plant trees to offset carbon and other such offerings from the likes of Atmos and Aspiration (which is also due to go public sometime soon) in the US or Tomorrow and Sweep in the EU.
You can also look to invest in a suitable 'green' ETF, green bonds, or stock of companies which adhere to a green agenda you approve of.... many options nowadays, from both a consumer and an investor perspectives.
I personally invest in 2 ETFs
MSCI World SRI A2DVB9
MSCI EM SRI A2AFCZ
I don’t think individual decisions comprise a large chunk of energy output that can be accounted in climate change, itself, but I do think there are individual actions that can be taken that are are both environmentally friendly and economically beneficial.
What I’m referring to is the over-discounting phenomenon. It’s shown most individual consumers buy less inefficient products, because they are cheaper. They don’t take into account that more efficient products which cost more at the initial purchase, yield high return on investment over time and will eventually save you money. So there exists some financial incentive for people to make energy efficient purchases. The issue is that there is a significant lack of information publicly available to laymen consumers who aren’t engineers or energy experts.
I think if this information was publicly available, easily readable, and for little to no cost to the consumer, then demand for energy efficient appliances and products would go up. This would, in turn, transfer into an increase in energy efficient supply and decrease in energy inefficient supply, creating further benefit, overall. It would make the economy both more sustainable and more eco-friendly.",2 years ago,[],Discussion / Question

I want to put aside money to offset my carbon emissions. Where should I put my money?,"I have been thinking about offsetting some of my carbon emissions by allocating money each month to a suitable carbon-offsetting activity. I have landed on making either monthly or annual donations to reforestation projects.
I have estimated that I emit about 7.2 tons of CO2 annually just from driving around ( 15 gal/tank * 1 tank/week * 53 weeks/year, rounding up * 9kg of CO2/gal = ~7.2 tons of CO2 from driving).
I am considering donating to onetreeplanted to plant mangroves because I care specifically about protecting coastlines and apparently mangroves have great carbon sequestration and storage potential.
I am thinking of donating to plant 50 mangrove trees a month ($50/month). Of course a tree sequesters carbon throughout its entire lifetime, so I figure that eventually the cumulative carbon sequestration rate of all the trees I fund will exceed my emission rate and I will become net-negative.
Does this make sense? Is onetreeplanted the best organization to donate toward? I suppose at some point it's a matter of faith and trust that they are using my funds for their stated purpose. I'm just wondering if there are better ways for me to spend that same amount of cash ($600/year) that will either provide equivalent carbon offsets and more immediate/proximate feedback. I live in the American midwest, so perhaps there are local alternatives that I don't know about.

I intend to explore Aspiration going public as a precursor, which brings me to my question - in the news release linked below it was stated that they ""one of the first consumer financial services institution to be publicly listed that is also a Public Benefit Corporation"" which is a term I hadn't encountered prior to be honest.
Unfortunately, Wikipedia has a very weak page on the subject and other sources are either vague or a bit shady (so you're saying Wikipedia.. no no no we're not having this discussion lol). Can anyone point me to an information source, or shed light on the subject of these so-called B-Corps? When did they become a thing? Is it a recent creation? Are there any concrete standards?

Crypto tokens promise investor wealth AND carbon reduction. Scam?,,"Crypto-Nero is fiddling while Rome is burning. Even if there was an asteroid heading towards Earth and certain civilizational destruction some people would still peddle a crypto-scheme or another (maybe promising a rich eternal afterlife using a limited supply of ""aftercoins""?).

Imho, there are easier safer methods to achieve carbon reduction at best. Climeworks does direct air capture of carbondioxide and mineralizes it. (more permanent than stuffing it in flammable wood while forest fires become more prominent. Effectively putting carbon back into the long cycle instead of the short cycle.) There are plenty of tree planting initiatives that do just fine without the market volatility of crypto. Tracking progress is definitely a good thing but has a cost somebody has to pay, I've not yet seen (2 min research) that being taken into account yet. Justdiggit tracks it's progress in greenifing efforts. Check the effective altruism sub-reddit for more effective means. Let's take a look at greenstand. The ""marketplace"" does nothing but match donors to causes. There is no monetary profit model for the market, the expenses are clear, the monetary income model does not exist. Imho it's just crowd-funding donations with extra steps. Extra steps means more points or failure and higher expenses. Nftree: transparent carbon capture certificates, good initiative. Has potentially via certificates an income model, can't judge it's viability as I know too little about the trade in that type of certificates. Cryptotrees is a charity with a nice match between donation and promised result. The nft is a nice gimmick. Single.earth is basically a cryptomarket for green certificates. I like that Aside from the blockchain nothing new here. I hope they can get their certificates internationally recognised. Investment wise it appears very high risk to me. I dislike the use of buzzwords and the interview with Forbes not matching with the 'how it works' section of the site. This indicates that the goal is not sharp on the mind of the ceo. Keep in mind that selling the tokens is effectively the same as emitting that amount of carbondioxide so that reduces the green investment part. I don't get how ""seeds"" works. If someone can explain to me how the currency is linked to the good causes that would be great. I suspect that a part of the transacting costs are going to a fund, and people vote which initiative gets the fund. The tokens of this fund are than burned. Will edit once I get what is going on. Be aware of https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory when putting money in the seeds tokens and expecting to make a profit. For carbon capture I've not come across anything beating climeworks. For reforestation I suggest looking into less convoluted charities. For making money I suggest a nice green (bonds) etf or crowd-funding. In conclusion I'm not convinced that block-chain has significant added value over the existing options.
Do you know more about Just Diggit? I see the same before and after picture of holes in the ground then bushes used on all their materials. It seems crazy to me that they are raising a bunch of funding to go out and dig holes in the desert and not continue to share new updates on their work.
I know they are recognised as a charity by the Dutch government. (ANBI status) at https://justdiggit.org/nl/over-ons/partners/ you can find their partners. Their website states that they don't own the land. Once it is green, and thus of higher value to the owner (so they are motivated to keep it that way) you gotta move on. So at a certain point the work is done I suppose and it's time to move on to the next project. If you want you can track the hole you 'purchased', then you should be able to track the results with more frequent updates. What appealed to me was the measuring of the effect and not just throwing money at it. Sadly this part is less visible on the new website. You can contact them at info@justdiggit.org and you can write to them in English.
That is roughly all the relevant things I know.
Yea. I will need to look into it more. Still skeptical. Thanks!
I'm heavily involved in a blockchain project that's attempting to do a better job at this actually. If you have interest, I can send some market research I've been adding to over a few weeks. Esg's are another route for this stuff. My own project is taking a focus on the potential market overlaps between multiple markets to be a sort of media platform for where donations go and trace what they fund in ecological work. The notion is to double the dollar value of the donation so investors recoup the amount and the ecological initiative gets funded. So it's a value capture scheme using crypto as a media and social network. You're quite right about the buzzwords and nonsense that gets thrown into these charity arguments. I'm much less comfortable saying it's more efficient but I feel there's an argument that it could be more transparent and the PR need for crypto to show environmental use cases creates a strong market for these projects. It may att least mean less money goes into other crypto sectora and goes back to environmental work. At least that's the theory. In practice I'm 50/50 split on whether we can make it work or end up another high risk hype venture clothed in trees and bs slogans about global warming.
Another potential idea is to gameify the crowdfuunding to get a lot of users into the platform. It's changing the notion that environmental work is hopeless and charities are bloated scams that produce shoddy work and hype it to talk you into giving more money
Really the key bit my project is betting on is that we can create a genuine community of experts and committees to verify the ecological work and openly criticize initiatives with efficiency metrics and really get peer review into the model. It's still a challenge I'm working at but we sorely need advisors. In a few weeks, once we're funded, my first emails are going to advisor candidates that know lifetimes more about these topics than I do.

GARP SCR certificate - just no,"I wanted to leave some feedback for any folks out there who are considering to take the GARP SCR exam to move into Climate and ESG Risk. I have been looking at certification for my team in Banking and just want to highlight why the GARP SCR certification is not worth time and effort. While the material tested is somewhat up to date - it has a heavy US centric focus and the assessment method is incongruent with the presented content. They seem to have little subject matter expertise and are experimenting with the bi-annual cohorts. Specifically ominous is the approach they are taking to their own assessment - here a description of their own:
GARP follows best practices for grading exams. The SCR Exam uses a modified Angoff method that relies on subject matter experts to examine each question on the exam and to determine an appropriate cut score, which will ultimately determine a candidate’s pass or fail result. Percentile range data is also provided as a broad guideline to show you what your performance was relative to your peers taking the exam on the same day. This is valuable information if you did not pass the exam in that it will direct you to the areas that need improvement.
Please note that the percentile ranges (currently reported in quartiles covering 25% of the overall score distribution) are broad and that your individual performance could be anywhere within that range. Additionally, subject area values are not evenly distributed. Performing well in smaller subject areas will not have as great an impact on your overall performance as performing well in larger subject areas.
Taken in context, this means many candidates may have the same or very similar percentile range performance across subject areas with some passing and some failing because their scores vary by a sizeable margin. The percentile ranges are issued to provide you with a more in-depth view of your performance so you may know what path you need to take in your studies; they cannot be used to make strict comparisons to another candidates’ overall score.

Best route to a career in sustainable finance,"Hi, so for reference, I am currently a fresh graduate of Civil Engineering from a state university. Obviously CE is a very broad Major that covers a multitude of disciplines but I did have a concentration in water and air pollution control. Anyways, after analyzing the current job market, I feel as if the most promising career trajectory for me would be somewhere in the sustainable finance field. I have a passion for finance & economics (in the past few years I have tried to learn a lot more on my own) and the convergence of these fields seems to fit well for me and my interests.
I’ve read some books on the circular economy and how the framework for a net zero economy can be developed. The topic of sustainability is obviously of crucial importance in the coming years of a potential ecological collapse. Anyways, I’m trying to figure out the best route to take to maximize my chance at progressing in a career in sustainable finance.
So, I applied to a few jobs and I already received an offer to be an environmental & sustainable engineer at a Honda aviation plant. Now that would be important experience but I Don’t think that’ll lead me onto a path that can incorporate the financial aspect of my career goals. The other option would be attending a graduate program and getting my masters in sustainable finance. However, my issue with that is not many schools offer such a field as it is still in its infancy and is only offered by top tier universities (like ivys) and prominent european schools. I’m not sure if I can get into these programs despite my passions due to previous academic performance (my first 2.5 years of college, I didn’t put in as much effort). What do you guys think?
I do have a decent knowledge and have actual experience in developing emissions reduction strategies for industrial Processes and feasibility of carbon offsets. This experience was for a senior project where I had to work with some reps for Taiwan Semiconductor who are building a massive wafer plant nearby my university. I was tasked with figuring out a feasible way to reduce their emissions footprint (it was very in depth and a full year project as they have a lot of suppliers and use PFCs for a lot of their manufacturing processes). Not to mention I have read many books and research studies about the potential framework for the circular economy and how to maximize stakeholder value among it. Obviously policy can differ but it stressed the key aspects of reducing environmental risk at all stages of material sourcing/procurement, production/manufacturing and waste removal. Part of this knowledge is what got me the Honda job after 2 interviews with a fairly lucrative offer for an entry level engineer.
So could anybody with insight into the industry advise me on what would be the best approach? Thanks so much","Hey man! You've exactly described my situation too. Though I'll be starting my master's in environmental engineering this fall, even I'm inclined towards entering the ESG and sustainable finance after graduation. I believe my master's will help me develop a strong base for the ""E"" of ESG and I plan to get certified in either the SASB certification or the CFA's ESG certificate, or both idk to ""round it up"".
You can also think about doing SASB’s FSA certification. It’s two exams. That would give you an edge.
I was looking into this. Did you achieve the certification? Curious on your thoughts on the process as well as its value.
Check out altiorem.org and do some volunteering with them. Great opportunity for specific work in a very young career path.
I just did that. I would be interested in volunteering but the sheer amount of research studies they have is phenomenal! I have reading material for months now! Thanks so much

How to Separate Real ESG Funds From the Not-So-Real,,"Quite a good read actually which is rare for this sector. A bit of backbone being shown too, naming specific funds and and investments which are engaging in this shady practice.
I'm of the opinion that the finance sector has jumped headlong into ""ESG"" without bothering to add skilled people to its ranks who know the topics - and I am referring to scientists, ecologist, environmental and social experts here. Putting an accountant or investment analyst thought a few days of ESG-training is a poor substitute for having someone who has a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between human activity and the social and environmental spheres.
spot on. a large part of what the financial industry does is agnostic ""intermediation"". the standard machinery is ready to call everything and anything an ""asset"" if there are enough people willing to invest, trade etc to provide a steady fee income for intermediaries.
Without regulation and incentives (skin in the game) to drive deep investment in knowledge, risk management and infrastructure the sector drifts into rent extraction. ESG or ""ESG"", dollar or ""coin"", tulips or houses - all is game.

Showing green but not being green,"Yo peeps, A mega trend that the Economist magazine has been pointing out for several issues recently is the rampant green washing in ""ESG"" funds. Assets managers are getting creepy about millenial's money eager to invest in green companies. What that is doing is essentially incentivizing companies like Altria to hire the big four accounting firms of the world to assure or write fancy susty reports every year that the rating agencies eat up and give them a nice 'A+'. The idiot assets managers see that 'A+' and assume they are green, compare that against income statements, then reallocate. You see the problem here? Companies can show they are green, but not actually be green within the conventional theory of sustainability.
So, my questions are: -What do you all think of this trend? -What public companies are actually green, or actually trying? -Can sustainability actually be a practical investment thesis at this point, when not even the technology or business models have transitioned?","Big four firms are not giving ESG ratings but yes they can assist in sustainability reports that will become a part of a yearly report (management reporting). Data providers are giving the ratings nowadays (like Morningstar/Sustainalytics, MSCI etc). These providers do use managerial reports to get the rating but not only. They also have analysts working and they do have a look at adverse media for example. The problem I see though it’s just we are talking only about large companies that are not representing everything in the world that has to become green but only very little part of it.

Carbon Offsets vs. Sustainable Investing,"I've been thinking about buying carbon offsets to reduce my carbon footprint. Many carbon offsets have a price of around $15 per tonne CO2e. Is it possible to estimate the per-dollar impact of investing in renewable energy stocks or ESG funds for comparison?
To me, investing is a more powerful and sustainable way to decarbonize our energy system. Plus it keeps more money and power in the hands of the people who actually care.
Am I wrong?","great question a big issue for those of us that have been emitting for 50 years ,so I thunk that any positive steps help if everyone does a few small things ( look up how the ozone layer reduced during the covid slowdown) so we have dont some charity stuff .Yes I like blue ocean , yes sierra club , national parks foundation and about 10 others ,all personal choices and charity navigator is GREAT to avoid scammers and fakers.But also we moved our investing assets to the best most credible ESG firms like Calvert and Trillium and for our kids with small money benigro.com has no minimums . This is a great thread no matter what you do if you are part of the sustainable future you are helping .Gotta go put in my pool SOLAR HEATER !!
I agree with some of the redditors on the other thread of this- it's better to reduce your current footprint, purchase sustainably, and donate directly to charities that do good in the world rather than buying carbon offsets regularly.
I like using charity navigator to help assist in determining what charities I donate to (I try and research beyond that site alone too)
Also, don't get me wrong, if a site offers carbon offsets when I'm ordering stuff, I'll usually buy it anyways but I don't go out of my way to purchase additional offsets
