This project aims to determine the public's understanding and definitions of sustainable finance.
We use a web scraping script to obtain posts related to sustainable finance on Reddit and Twitter. 
The folder structure and the usage of each file are as follows:

-reddit
    |-code
        |-topic_imputation.ipynb # All the source code for textual analysis is applied to raw data obtained from posts in the sustainable finance forum on Reddit, including comments
        |-cleaning_reddit.ipynb # data preprocessing for Reddit data

    |-data
        |-Reddit.csv # Washed data processed based on raw data. See ../code/cleaning_reddit.ipynb for details.
    	|-Reddit_raw.csv # Raw and unwashed data obtained from posts in the sustainable finance forum on Reddit, including comments
    	|-stop_words.csv # Customized stop words list. A combination of a stop words list provided by  NLTK and our own understanding of the project.

    |-images # folder to store the figures that are preseted in markdown

-twitter
    |-code
        |-topic_imputation.ipynb # All the source code for textual analysis is applied to raw data obtained from posts on Twitter that contain 'sustainable finance' AND 'definition' or '#sustainablefinance' AND 'definition'
        |-cleaning_twitter.ipynb # data preprocessing for Twitter data

    |-data
        |-Twitter.csv # Washed data. See ../code/cleaning_twitter.ipynb for more details.
